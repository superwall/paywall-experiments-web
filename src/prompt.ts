# Paywall Experiments

## Hard paywall with free trial and eligibility-based exit (small-scale rollout)

**Description:** Test shifting from a soft, skippable paywall to a hard paywall to establish strong revenue/conversion benchmarks before exploring freemium or skippable flows. Prior testing showed moving to a hard paywall more than doubled conversion rate and roughly doubled proceeds per user. Expect some negative reviews; mitigate pushback by clearly messaging that a free trial is available.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that enforcing a hard paywall with clear free trial messaging—and only showing a soft exit (X) to users ineligible for a free trial—will increase conversion rate and proceeds per user by driving higher trial starts and trial-to-paid, while managing sentiment despite some negative reviews, compared to the current soft paywall.

**Control:** Current soft paywall with a visible close/skip (X) for all users, allowing entry to the app without starting a trial.

**Variant:** Hard paywall as default. For users eligible for a free trial: no close/skip button; starting the free trial is required to enter the app, with prominent messaging that a free trial is available. For users ineligible for a free trial: show the X (soft exit). Roll out to a small percentage of users first and closely monitor trial start rate, conversion rate, trial-to-paid, proceeds per user, retention, and reviews/sentiment before considering broader rollout.

## Multi‑arm Price Ladder and Trial Structure Test Across Tiers

**Description:** Systematically test price elasticity and trial impact by running multi‑arm price ladders for annual, lifetime, and premium monthly/annual tiers, alongside free and paid trial variants. The goal is to balance conversion lift and proceeds per user/ARPU. Prior example results indicate that introducing a free trial increased conversion by up to 45–50% and raised proceeds per user by 78–62.5%. Evaluate shifts in plan mix, conversion, ARPU, and trial outcomes to identify the optimal price/offer configuration.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that introducing trial structures (free, 30‑day paid, and one‑month paid intro) combined with laddered price testing across annual, lifetime, and premium tiers will increase proceeds per user (and in some cases conversion) because (a) prior examples show free trials can lift conversion 45–50% and proceeds per user 78–62.5%, and (b) multi‑point price ladders reveal price elasticity and optimal thresholds across markets.

**Control:** Current pricing and acquisition flow as‑is (existing price points and any current trial configuration), with no new trials or price‑ladder changes.

**Variant:** A multi‑arm price and trial test: (1) Price ladders: • Annual price points tested across $39/$49/$59 and $59/$99/$119 to capture elasticity in different markets. • Lifetime price points tested across $39/$49/$59. • Premium tier: pilot higher price points for premium annual and monthly options. (2) Trial structures: • Free trial added to the paywall for the above price ladders. • 30‑day paid trial to increase perceived value, then force payment at the selected annual price. • One‑month paid intro at $3.99 vs $5.99 that renews to annual. (3) Test design: run 4–6 concurrent price/offer arms to quickly eliminate weak performers, then refine with head‑to‑head tests among finalists. (4) Evaluation metrics: proceeds per user/ARPU, conversion rate, plan mix shifts, and trial outcomes (starts, conversions).

## Checkout-abandon intercept with eligibility- and product‑aware rescue offers

**Description:** When a user opens but closes the native purchase sheet (checkout abandonment), immediately present a dedicated recovery paywall with a tailored incentive. Offers are matched to the exact product abandoned and the user’s introductory‑offer eligibility, using simple, one‑time messaging. This targets high‑intent users at the moment of hesitation to recover conversions and revenue, while protecting ARPU by calibrating incentives by product tier and avoiding stacking trial+discount by default. Prior tests indicate extended trials for abandoners can dramatically lift proceeds per user (≈100% observed). Start with limited exposure (~10%) to limit cannibalization; expand if positive. Optionally trigger once on next app launch instead of immediately.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that immediately intercepting checkout abandonment with an eligibility‑ and product‑aware rescue paywall—offering an extended trial to intro‑eligible users or a discounted no‑trial introductory price to non‑eligible users—will increase recovery rate, net proceeds per user, and downstream retention versus no intercept, because it addresses the primary objections (price vs. needing more time) at peak intent, aligns to the product actually abandoned, keeps messaging simple/urgent, avoids stacking incentives, and calibrates by tier. We also expect deeper discounts (e.g., 50% vs. 25%) and paid upfront intros to outperform lighter or arbitrary discounts in many cases, while monitoring refund rates.

**Control:** Standard flow after the purchase sheet is dismissed: user returns to the prior screen/paywall with default pricing and trial lengths. No immediate rescue paywall, no limited‑time/one‑time messaging, and no eligibility‑ or product‑specific offer.

**Variant:** Immediate checkout‑abandon intercept with tailored offer and focused messaging:
- Trigger and targeting: Fire when the system/native purchase sheet is opened then closed without purchase. Restrict to users who abandoned a specific product; use the abandoned_product_id so the recovery offer matches the exact SKU/tier. Calibrate incentive by product tier (smaller discounts or different trials on higher‑priced tiers).
- Offer logic (avoid stacking trial+discount by default; prefer no‑trial for discounted offers):
  • If intro‑eligible: show an extended trial on the same product/tier (e.g., longer than the baseline 3‑day; 7–14 days). Reserve extended trials for abandoners only.
  • If not intro‑eligible: show a discounted introductory price with zero‑day trial on the same product/tier (e.g., percentage off first year, or a low‑cost first month that renews annually). Clearly show the discount percent and that renewal is at full price.
  • Alternative to evaluate where relevant: a simple, permanent 50% off weekly direct purchase (no trial) down‑sell; in some tests, this outperformed more complex intro designs.
  • Where discounts are used, consider testing deeper (e.g., 50%) versus lighter (e.g., 25%) and monitor refund rates.
- Personalization options: Optionally ask why they backed out (e.g., price too high vs. need more time) and route to the matching offer (discount vs. longer trial). Swap UI cards and CTAs based on intro‑eligibility.
- UX and urgency: Dedicated rescue paywall with clean design focused on the offer; use “limited‑time”/“one‑time offer” language. Optional countdown timer and brief personal‑style note. Ensure clarity on renewal to full price.
- Delivery timing: Show immediately upon dismissal of the purchase sheet. Optional alternative: trigger once on the next app launch via an occurrence rule.
- Rollout and measurement: Start at ~10% of eligible abandoners to limit cannibalization; expand if positive. Measure lift in recovery rate, proceeds/revenue per user, downstream retention, and refund rates. Where applicable, compare extended trial vs. discounted annual no‑trial and heavier vs. lighter discounts. Favor longer trials or pay‑upfront intros over arbitrary discounts when possible (also safer for app review).

## Segmented pricing by purchase power, geo/device, and demand with region-specific SKUs and localized paywalls

**Description:** Test whether combining purchase-power segmentation with geo/device-specific pricing, region-specific SKUs, and country-tailored paywalls/plan defaults increases ARPU/proceeds and conversion while avoiding under-pricing in high-inflation markets. This consolidates signals-based purchase-power tiers, country-level price optimization (including aggressive adjustments where needed), device/region price tests, day-of-week demand alignment, and market-specific plan strategies (e.g., Mexico, Germany, Brazil/India) using Apple’s localized pricing and separate SKUs for price-sensitive regions.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that segmenting users by inferred purchase power (using signals like country/locale, device model, time since install, total paywall views, engagement, network type, UI mode) and applying geo-, device-, and demand-aware pricing and plan defaults (with region-specific SKUs and country-specific paywalls) will lift ARPU/proceeds and conversion—while preventing unintended under-pricing in high-inflation markets—because prices and plan structures will better match local willingness to pay, device-based purchasing power, and temporal demand patterns.

**Control:** - One global price/SKU and generic paywall for all users and regions.
- No segmentation by purchase power, country/region, device, or day-of-week demand.
- Uniform plan defaults and trial/intro settings across markets.

**Variant:** - Purchase-power segmentation: Build an inferred purchase-power model using signals such as country/locale, device model, time since install, total paywall views, engagement, network type, and UI mode. Bucket users into tiers (e.g., platinum/gold/silver/bronze) or map a 0–99 demand score into price bands.
- Tiered differential pricing: Test different price points by tier (e.g., weekly at 15/10/5). Default lower-demand cohorts to lower-priced tiers; test higher prices for high-demand cohorts.
- Demand timing: Align price tests with weekday/weekend demand differences.
- Geo/device segmentation: Test higher prices in high-income states/regions and/or on newer/premium devices (especially on some Android models).
- Region-specific SKUs: Create separate product SKUs for tier‑2/price‑sensitive countries (rather than manually adjusting every country on one SKU). Use Apple’s localized pricing for most regions and test lower‑priced SKUs where appropriate.
- Country-level price optimization and audits: Re‑price by country to improve ARPU (including aggressive adjustments in select markets). Regularly audit countries with high inflation to prevent unintended under‑pricing.
- Market-specific paywalls and plans: Serve country‑specific paywalls reflecting local price norms. Adopt tiered pricing with lower price points in Brazil/Mexico/India. In Mexico, avoid trials due to prepaid cards and use upfront discounted intro pricing. In Germany, favor annual and lifetime over short intervals. Weekly plans often underperform in many regions; German users favor yearly, Japanese users favor short‑term.
- Calibration and optional UA: Calibrate with controlled experiments before automating. Optionally, adjust UA targeting based on where high‑demand users cluster.

## Platform- and Market-Specific Pricing and Trials (Android, iOS, Web)

**Description:** Test platform-specific pricing, trial lengths, and paywall creative across iOS, Android, and web, with Android-focused price reductions and shorter trials, plus per‑country and device‑tier segmentation where allowed. This matters because user behavior and price sensitivity differ by platform and market (Android often more price‑sensitive; web frequently sits between iOS and Android). Shorter trials, especially in emerging markets, can improve conversion and limit refund exposure. Different prices by platform can increase overall revenue despite lower list prices on some surfaces. Implement transparently and ethically.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that keeping prices and trials independent by platform and market—lowering Android prices iteratively (e.g., ~10%, ~12%, up to ~30% vs iOS), using shorter Android trials (3‑day vs 7‑day and testing no‑trial with a direct paid intro), setting web pricing between iOS and Android, segmenting high‑volume Android markets, and adapting paywall creative per platform—will increase conversion and overall revenue/proceeds and reduce refund exposure, because Android audiences tend to be more price‑sensitive with different payment behaviors, web often sits between iOS and Android, and tailoring by OS/device tier reflects differences in perceived value. Winners will be validated per platform rather than assumed transferable.

**Control:** Parity approach: identical price points, trial lengths, and paywall creative across iOS, Android, and web (e.g., mirroring iOS pricing and a longer 7‑day trial on Android), with no per‑country or device‑tier differentiation and minimal re‑validation across platforms.

**Variant:** Platform- and market-specific approach: • Android: run pricing independent of iOS; reduce price anchors stepwise (~10%, ~12%, up to ~30% vs iOS); test shorter trials (3‑day vs 7‑day) and a no‑trial direct paid intro; then split by high‑volume countries to find market‑specific optima. Monitor trial‑to‑paid conversion, refunds, and retention. • iOS: keep pricing/trials independent from Android; validate any changes on iOS before transferring. • Web: set pricing independent of apps, commonly positioned between iOS and Android; keep trials independent. • Segmentation: where business rules allow, tailor prices by OS and device tier; implement transparently and ethically. • Design: adapt paywall layout/creative per platform. • Replication: run the same experiment on each platform to confirm or reject transferability; avoid mirroring by default.

## Unified paywall placement and timing optimization to maximize reach and net-new proceeds

**Description:** Test earlier and contextual paywall placements versus a single end-of-onboarding placement to raise paywall reach toward ~80–95% while protecting share UX and increasing proceeds per user. This experiment compares app-open, onboarding, and in-product trigger timings; uses OR logic to maximize exposure; and monitors downstream conversion, trial metrics, and share impact. It also tracks paywall view rate to detect and fix under-exposure (e.g., SDK init/remote config timing or locale gating) and distinguishes net-new versus shifted revenue when adding placements.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing the paywall earlier and across multiple high-intent triggers—with tailored strength by placement (soft at app open with caps; stronger trial-forward during onboarding; optional/dismissible before key reveals; delayed after share; on “Next” in carousels)—will increase paywall reach to ~80–95% and lift net proceeds per new user versus a single end-of-onboarding paywall, because it reduces pre-paywall friction (e.g., account creation), leverages context/sunk cost after minimal onboarding, avoids interrupting share flows, and ensures more users encounter at least one paywall. Measuring per-placement trials, trial-to-paid, and a holdout for app-open exposure will validate incremental impact and guard against shifted revenue.

**Control:** Current baseline with the first paywall shown only at the end of onboarding (or requiring users to discover it later, e.g., in settings). No app-open soft paywall, no early/delayed share-specific timing, and no OR-combined triggers. Standard pre-paywall flow includes account creation where applicable. Track baseline paywall reach, conversion, trial starts, trial-to-paid, share rates, and proceeds.

**Variant:** Multi-cell variant comparing earlier and contextual placements/timing with exposure maximization and specificity by placement:
- App-open: Soft paywall on cold starts (not every foreground) with impression/frequency caps; test close button states (visible vs hidden vs delayed). Include a holdout group that never sees the app-launch paywall to estimate incremental impact.
- Onboarding sequencing: Show the first paywall (a) before account creation, (b) after minimal onboarding/setup (e.g., after entering initial info), and (c) after onboarding completion or specific milestones (e.g., after a value demo). Compare to app-open and end-of-onboarding placements.
- In-product triggers: After survey loader; on “Next” in a carousel (or after N cards) instead of interrupting a share; optional/dismissible soft paywall immediately before revealing key results; hard paywall after a share with timing variants (immediate vs 10 sec vs 30 sec delay).
- Exposure logic: Use OR logic across high-intent triggers (e.g., loader OR first share OR carousel Next) to ensure more users encounter at least one paywall during onboarding.
- Measurement: Monitor paywall view rate (coverage) for new installs and fix under-exposure (e.g., SDK init/remote config timing or locale gating). Measure per-placement trial starts and trial-to-paid, proceeds per user, share impact, and net-new vs shifted revenue. Benchmark early hard-gate proceeds against the sum of soft paywall plus downstream placements. Use seeds/placement filters to isolate cohorts and compare proceeds per user across placements.

## Immediate, onboarding-embedded paywall to maximize day-one paywall reach

**Description:** Test moving the first paywall to immediately after install and embedding it as a natural “continue” step in onboarding. The goal is to ensure nearly all new users encounter a paywall early (operational target: ~80–95% of installs see a paywall on day one) because paywall rate is a primary lever for revenue and is reported to correlate linearly with revenue lift. The paywall should be compliant (price, renewal terms, readable fonts), minimal and benefit-focused, include a free trial, appear before account creation, and support “Continue as guest.” Ensure restore purchase flows and subscription detection handle edge cases. Track “paywall rate” daily as a core KPI.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a compliant, trial-enabled paywall immediately after install—before account creation and with a “Continue as guest” option—will raise paywall reach to ~80–95% of new installs and increase trial starts and revenue (often with little or no negative effect on per‑paywall conversion) because user motivation is highest post‑install and earlier paywall exposure is highly correlated with revenue.

**Control:** Current onboarding flow where the paywall is not shown immediately after install (often appears after higher‑friction steps like account creation or deeper in settings). Existing copy/compliance and any trial offering remain as is; no explicit guarantee that all new users encounter a paywall early.

**Variant:** Show the paywall immediately post‑install as a natural onboarding “continue” step. Include a free trial. Keep copy minimal and benefit‑focused and ensure compliance (price, renewal terms, readable font sizes). Place the paywall before account creation and add a “Continue as guest” option to bypass account creation while still surfacing the paywall early. Ensure restore purchase flows and subscription detection cover edge cases. Aim for ~80–95% of new installs to see a paywall on day one and monitor paywall rate daily as a core KPI.

## Exit-intent offer on paywall close: presence vs. absence with offer-type and UI variants

**Description:** Intercept paywall dismissals with a one-time alternate offer to recover would-be exits. Prior teams observed 5–15% incremental revenue from exit offers. This test quantifies net lift, minimizes cannibalization, and identifies the best offer type and presentation while maintaining good UX/policy compliance. Scope to onboarding and high-value feature paywalls, limit frequency to avoid training users, and trigger only from the paywall’s close (X)—not from a dismissed system purchase sheet. Keep users in-flow by routing back to the prior step if they still decline and keep analytics clean via a separate campaign and placement scoping.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a one-time exit-intent offer when users tap the paywall close (X)—featuring an alternate incentive (cheaper price, longer trial, different term) and presented in a friction-reducing UI—will increase attach rate, incremental conversions, and ARPU/proceeds per user without materially increasing refunds or cannibalizing downstream conversions, because it captures otherwise lost intent, keeps users in-flow, and avoids jarring/policy-risky transitions.

**Control:** Baseline paywall behavior with a clean exit: when users dismiss the paywall (including hard paywall placements), no exit-intent modal or re-show is presented; users return to the previous context. No secondary offers, no discount depth tests, and no alternate UI presentations. Applied to the same scoped placements (onboarding and selected high-value feature paywalls).

**Variant:** On paywall close (X), present a one-time exit-intent offer, targeted only to a randomized seed cohort (e.g., half of users) to measure net lift and avoid suppression from showing it to everyone. Use a separate campaign and placement filters so it triggers only in selected placements (onboarding/high-value features). Within the variant, randomize sub-arms to compare: 
- Offer type: 
  • Lifetime vs. discounted annual (e.g., $20/year, no trial)
  • Discounted first year (including discount depth, e.g., $49.99 vs. $34.99)
  • Monthly fallback when the main paywall led with annual (and vice versa)
  • Longer trial instead of/alongside a discount (e.g., extend from 14 to 30 days)
- Presentation/UI: 
  • Compact bottom sheet/drawer vs. full-screen takeover
  • Pre-select the alternate product and update the selected state to reduce friction
  • Optional messaging that restates value or frames a “one-time/special gift” offer
- Mechanics/UX: 
  • Trigger from the paywall’s close (X), not from a dismissed system purchase sheet
  • If declined, route back to the prior step instead of fully closing the flow
  • Use the paywall-decline re-show as a quick fallback/rescue paywall
  • Limit frequency (one-time) and sequence thoughtfully if testing a ladder (e.g., annual → monthly → alternate incentive) with policy awareness
  • Apply to hard paywalls where relevant (e.g., first-year 50% discount) 
- Measurement: 
  • Attach rate from the exit UI (e.g., drawer) 
  • Incremental conversions, proceeds per user/ARPU, and refunds 
  • Compare uplift by market/platform 
  • Cannibalization check via seeded cohorts: compare downstream conversions from other placements between exposed vs. unexposed users

## Exit/abandon/decline offer framework: longer trial vs discounted first term vs low‑cost intro vs alternate plan (with higher list price + stronger abandon offer)

**Description:** Test targeted offers shown at exit, checkout abandonment, and paywall decline to increase revenue without permanently lowering list price. Compare a longer trial, discounted first‑term (first‑year) intro, low‑cost paid intro that renews at full price, and alternate weekly/monthly plans. Include a pricing strategy where a higher annual list price paired with a steeper abandoned discount is compared to a lower starting price. Measure net conversion, long‑term ARPU, conversion uplift across the funnel, and impact on refunds.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing targeted offers when users exit, abandon checkout, or decline the paywall—specifically: (a) a limited discounted first‑year intro, (b) an extended trial, (c) a low‑cost paid intro that renews at full price, or (d) an alternate weekly/monthly plan—will increase net conversion and long‑term ARPU. We also believe deep first‑year discounts can outperform longer trials, that leading with a higher annual list price paired with a stronger abandoned discount can produce more revenue than a lower starting price, and that low‑commitment exit offers reduce refunds from large upfront annual charges.

**Control:** Current paywall and checkout experience as‑is (current list price and trial settings), with no new exit‑intent, decline, or abandoned‑checkout offers introduced by this test.

**Variant:** Introduce exit‑intent, paywall‑decline, and abandoned‑checkout offers:

- Trigger points:
  - On close/exit
  - On checkout abandonment
  - For users who close the initial paywall dialog (first‑time offer with increased discount depth for this audience)

- Offer arms to compare:
  1) Longer trial (e.g., +4 days) at the same price
  2) Discounted direct subscription for the first term (first‑year); test deep first‑year discounts and milder 20–40% discounts
  3) Low‑cost paid intro that renews at full price (e.g., $5 first month or a 3‑day paid pass)
  4) Alternate plan options (e.g., weekly or monthly)

- Pricing strategy arm:
  - Lead with a higher annual list price and pair it with a steeper abandoned discount; compare against a lower starting price, ensuring abandon flows are included in the A/B

- Prioritization guidance:
  - Start with lower‑risk extended trials for abandoners; if insufficient, test discounted first‑year prices without trials

- Measurement:
  - Track net conversion, conversion uplift across the whole funnel, long‑term ARPU, and refunds

## Segmented multi-arm price ladder optimized on proceeds per user with 95% CIs

**Description:** Test a wide range of prices on an identical paywall design across demand cohorts, and choose winners using proceeds per user (ARPU per paywall view) with 95% confidence intervals. Evaluate not just initial conversion but also trial-to-paid (once matured) and retention proxies to avoid selecting high-CVR, low-revenue variants. This captures price elasticity effects (e.g., higher prices may not dent initial conversion but can reduce trial-to-paid) and aligns decisions with scalable UA economics. If confidence intervals overlap meaningfully and lift is marginal, treat as null, adopt the simpler option, and reallocate traffic to higher-impact ideas.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running multi-cell price ladders (current, higher, lower) within each demand segment and selecting winners by proceeds per user (including direct buys and converted trials) using 95% confidence intervals—while considering trial-to-paid and retention proxies—will increase ARPU per paywall view versus choosing by conversion rate alone, because higher prices can maintain initial conversion yet change downstream trial performance, and ARPU captures the true revenue trade-offs.

**Control:** Current price in each demand cohort shown on the existing, identical paywall design (no multi-arm ladder). Outcomes tracked as baseline, including conversion and ARPU per paywall view.

**Variant:** Multi-arm price testing on the same paywall design, with 3–6 prices spanning low to high. Within each demand cohort, test the current price against a higher and a lower price (and additional steps as needed). Compute ARPU per paywall view (net proceeds per unique viewer, including direct purchases and converted trials). Use 95% confidence intervals on proceeds per user (and on trial-to-paid once matured) to call winners. Select variants by ARPU (and retention proxies), not conversion alone. If conversion and ARPU confidence intervals overlap meaningfully and lift is marginal, stop early, treat as null, adopt the simpler variant, and reallocate traffic. Allow for outcomes where lower prices outperform across segments; let the data decide.

## Reverse trial (24h–7d) with aggressive countdown and explicit post‑trial paywall

**Description:** Test a reverse‑trial model that grants time‑limited access upfront (without using the app store trial) and pairs it with prominent countdown messaging and explicit post‑expiry paywall copy. This includes: a 7‑day or 3‑day full‑access window for new users (bypassing an upfront hard paywall), a one‑day full‑access promo, a 24‑hour “day‑0” basic access path for onboarding bypassers, and a short (1–3 day) full‑access window after a paywall decline. At expiry, features lock and the first paywall explicitly acknowledges the end of the free period, contrasts free vs premium, visualizes that the free allotment is used, and highlights what is lost without upgrading. Prior implementations credited aggressive countdown and clear consequences with strong conversion uplift; one‑day unlocks were reported as a ‘blast’ to conversion due to strong product tasting and can be a powerful try‑before‑you‑buy lever, especially on Android. Treat as an experiment and watch cohort quality; a limited free‑access day followed by a hard paywall correlated with higher conversions afterward.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that granting short, upfront access (24 hours to 7 days) with an aggressive countdown and explicit post‑expiry messaging will increase conversion after the free period (and on re‑prompt after a paywall decline) and preserve retention for users who bypass onboarding, because strong product tasting, urgency, and clear loss framing motivate upgrades.

**Control:** Current experience without a timed full‑access (or day‑0 basic access) window: no reverse trial, no aggressive in‑app countdown or once‑per‑day bottom‑drawer reminder, and no post‑trial paywall that explicitly acknowledges the end of the free period or visualizes the used free days.

**Variant:** Implement a reverse‑trial flow not tied to the app store trial system: 1) New users: grant full access for a short window (e.g., 3 or 7 days, or a one‑day promo), then lock features. 2) Paywall decline: if a user declines, allow full access for a short window (e.g., 1–3 days), then lock features and present the paywall again. 3) Onboarding bypass: give 24 hours of basic access before gating to preserve retention; when locking, show a “trial extension” paywall. Countdown and reminders: show an aggressive countdown with clear post‑expiry consequences; surface it prominently on the home screen or via a once‑per‑day bottom‑drawer reminder. Post‑trial paywall: explicitly acknowledge the free period has ended; contrast free vs premium; visualize that the free period is used (e.g., strike‑through checked days or “0 free days left”); highlight benefits lost without upgrading. After a one‑day full‑access promo, follow with a hard paywall. This try‑before‑you‑buy lever has been reported as especially strong on Android.

## Hybrid External Checkout with Dynamic Paywall Routing (Stripe/Shopify + Wallets)

**Description:** Test routing physical product upsells, media/coaching add-ons, and higher-LTV annual plans to external web checkout (Stripe mobile-optimized with Apple Pay/Google Pay/Link; Shopify for physical products) while keeping lower-LTV monthly plans on IAP. The paywall dynamically asks what users already own, presents the correct SKU and discount, links to the right storefront URL, and records a user attribute (e.g., purchased) to suppress future offers. This aims to bypass App Store fees (30%), enable immediate purchase, allow flexible pricing, and leverage a clearer, lighter checkout UI that has materially improved web conversion in practice.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that linking in-app paywall/banners to external web checkout (Stripe/Shopify), using Stripe’s mobile-optimized checkout with one-click wallets, and dynamically routing offers (annual via web; monthly via IAP) will increase conversion and margins for physical product upsells, media/coaching add-ons, and annual subscriptions because it bypasses App Store fees, enables immediate purchase, uses a clearer, lighter checkout UI, presents the correct SKU/discount, and suppresses irrelevant future offers.

**Control:** All purchases flow through IAP with a standard paywall: annual and monthly subscriptions, add-ons, and upsells are purchased in-app; no external web checkout; no ownership question; no dynamic SKU/discount selection or storefront URL; no Apple Pay/Google Pay/Link wallets; no user attribute recorded to suppress future offers.

**Variant:** Implement external checkout integration and dynamic routing: (1) Physical product upsells link from the paywall to external checkout (Stripe or Shopify) to bypass App Store fees and enable immediate purchase. (2) Use Stripe’s mobile-optimized checkout with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Link. (3) When users hit pre-defined thresholds, open a product offer paywall that asks what they already own, presents the correct SKU and discount, links to the right storefront URL dynamically, and records a user attribute (e.g., purchased) to suppress future offers. (4) For human-assisted or one-time services and media/coaching add-ons, link from an in-app paywall or banner to a Stripe web checkout (processed via a separate billing gateway) to reduce the Apple commission fee and allow flexible pricing. (5) Mix checkout methods: route higher-LTV annual purchases to web checkout; keep lower-LTV monthly purchases on IAP to reduce complexity.

## Broad annual price sweep (monthly fixed) with alternative anchors and trial configurations

**Description:** Test a wide range of annual price points across distinct tiers while keeping the monthly plan fixed, adding alternative anchors (weekly/quarterly) and longer-interval options (6‑month, quarterly). Use bold price steps first to map elasticity, then refine. Measure proceeds per user, mix, retention, trial conversion, and realized LTV over ~2 weeks with confidence intervals to identify optimal price and validate higher price ceilings. Incorporate tests with and without trials and exit offers, noting that some midpoints can underperform.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sweeping annual price points across low/mid/high/very high tiers—including higher anchors—and introducing alternative anchors (weekly/quarterly), while keeping monthly fixed, will increase proceeds per user and realized LTV because initial conversion tends to remain stable while trial‑to‑paid shifts with price. A higher yearly price with a trial (e.g., >25% discount vs 12× monthly) may offset trial-to-pay changes and lift revenue. We expect some midpoints (e.g., 79) to underperform, and to observe audience-specific ceilings (e.g., ~$40 outperforming while ~$50 under‑performing in some placements).

**Control:** Current pricing setup: existing annual price point with the current trial and exit-offer configuration (if any), current anchor products (if any), and the existing monthly price (unchanged). No additional alternative interval price points are shown.

**Variant:** Multi‑arm annual pricing sweep with monthly price held constant:
- Annual tiers: low/mid/high/very high using broad points (e.g., 49.99, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99.99, 119, 129) and bold steps (e.g., $60 vs $90 vs $120). Include +$10–$20 above control and a lower‑than‑control arm. Explore higher ceilings observed elsewhere (e.g., ~$15→~$30; ~$40; ~$50).
- Alternative anchors and intervals: add weekly or quarterly anchors; include longer-interval options such as 39.99 per 6 months and 39.99 per quarter; pair annual options with a weekly anchor where applicable.
- Trial and offer configurations: test with and without trials and exit offers; include a higher yearly price with a trial that maintains >25% discount vs 12× monthly; run as controlled cohorts.
- Measurement and runtime: run ~2 weeks per arm; evaluate proceeds per user with confidence intervals; track plan mix, retention, trial conversion, and realized LTV.
- Approach: start with larger increments to find the response curve quickly, then refine around promising tiers with smaller steps; avoid testing many $10 steps at once to reduce noise.

## App-to-Web Stripe Checkout (Safari vs In-App) with Auto Entitlement Sync

**Description:** Test routing purchases from the final paywall step and win-back/upgrade campaigns to a Stripe-powered web checkout, then deep link back to auto-sync entitlements and close the paywall. This matters to reduce platform fees (~25–27%), enable fast A/B of web-only discounts (including email-driven win-backs and traffic from ads/influencers), and leverage native wallets (Apple Pay, Link, PayPal). Prior tests showed ~12% lower initial conversion but ~20%+ proceeds gains; many teams see higher conversion when opening checkout in Safari vs in-app webviews. Caveats: lifetime may not be supported; multi-year non‑renewables can substitute but require in‑app sign-in (drop-off risk); card expirations can increase involuntary churn on 2‑year+ plans; be mindful of chargebacks and cancellation UX; some policies require external browsers.

**Hypothesis:** We believe routing paywall and win-back purchases to a Stripe web checkout—preferably opened in Safari—and auto-redeeming access via deep link will increase overall proceeds and may improve trial-to-paid, despite a possible initial conversion drop, because it avoids store fees, enables rapid offer iteration with web-only discounts, and leverages saved payment methods (Apple Pay/Link/PayPal). We expect Safari to outperform in-app webviews and will mitigate risk by starting with limited segments (e.g., yearly plan or abandoners).

**Control:** Current flow: paywall CTA opens the native in-app purchase sheet; purchases complete via app stores with standard entitlement sync. No web checkout, no external browser handoff, no deep-link auto-redeem, and no web-only discount or email win-back checkout paths.

**Variant:** Replace the native purchase sheet with a web checkout flow using Stripe and entitlement sync: (a) From the final paywall step, route CTA to web checkout and, upon success, deep link back with a token/magic link to auto-sync entitlements and auto-close the paywall; pass the app user ID in the checkout URL/metadata to map the purchase; provide an in-app link to a web subscription portal for cancel/pause. (b) Test entry patterns and browser context: 1) app → Safari web paywall → checkout, 2) app → Safari direct checkout, 3) app → in-app webview checkout; compare conversion and drop-off. Where policy requires, use external browser; otherwise compare both, noting many teams see higher conversion in Safari due to saved wallets. (c) Apply to limited segments first (e.g., yearly only, abandoners/churned) and to win-backs/upgrades with web-only discounts; optionally lower web prices to reflect fee savings (~25–27%). (d) Caveats to monitor: lifetime may not be supported; multi-year non‑renewables require user sign-in in-app (drop-off risk); card expirations can raise involuntary churn on 2‑year+ plans; be mindful of chargebacks and cancellation UX.

## Annual-only (longer) trial with annual-first decoy layout vs visible monthly trial

**Description:** Test concentrating the free trial on the yearly plan and removing (or shortening and concealing) the trial on shorter terms while emphasizing yearly in the UI. Prior results cited: when monthly had a trial, plan mix split ~40–60 between monthly and annual; removing the monthly trial pushed ~90% to annual and raised ARPU, with a small drop in initial paywall conversion. Other observations: near-term proceeds improved; direct subs increased on day 0; ARPU at day 7/10 rose; overall trial starts may decline but revenue impact is often net positive; positioning annual as the better value nudges mix without changing base prices. This experiment matters to increase proceeds per user/ARPU, mitigate trial churn, and push users toward higher-LTV plans while preserving choice.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the advertised monthly trial while keeping (and potentially lengthening) the annual trial, and making the annual plan the primary, preselected option will shift selection strongly toward annual (often ~90%), increase proceeds per user and near-term proceeds, raise ARPU (including by day 7/10), and mitigate trial churn—despite a small drop in initial paywall conversion and fewer overall trial starts—because the annual plan is framed as the best value and the monthly trial is either absent, shorter, or concealed.

**Control:** Current paywall with visible trials on both plans. Annual and monthly both advertise a free trial (commonly same or similar length, e.g., 7 days). Trial language is shown on monthly/quarterly where applicable, and any free‑trial timeline appears for all eligible plans. Monthly trial is fully visible/advertised. Layout uses the existing selector without explicitly preselecting or styling yearly as the primary choice.

**Variant:** Annual-only trial emphasis with monthly no (or shorter) trial and annual-first decoy layout. • Annual plan: offers a free trial (optionally longer than shorter terms, e.g., 7 days) and is displayed as the primary, preselected option; emphasize the relative discount. • Monthly (and other shorter terms like quarterly): remove their free trial (or shorten it, e.g., to 3 days); remove trial language and do not display a free-trial timeline for these plans. • Concealment: keep the monthly trial technically available under the hood but do not advertise it. • Copy/UI: dynamically swap trial copy so only the eligible plan (annual) shows free-trial messaging; present a two‑product comparison with monthly as a no‑trial decoy; style yearly as selected and highlight the relative discount; do not change base prices. • Measurement focus: plan mix shift toward annual, proceeds per user/overall proceeds, near‑term proceeds, trial‑to‑paid conversion, overall trial starts, initial paywall conversion, day‑0 direct subs, ARPU at day 7/10, and downstream LTV.

## Metered gating with progressive prompts and threshold testing

**Description:** Implement a usage- and session-metered freemium gate that counts feature uses on the app side and triggers paywalls after N actions or sessions. This creates a predictable upgrade moment after clear value delivery while requiring minimal additional app logic beyond sending usage counters as user attributes. Test generosity (1 vs 3 vs 5 vs 10 free actions), compare usage-based vs session/time-based prompting, and include share gating depth (0, 1–2, 5). Aim to maximize upgrade conversion and revenue without harming UX or virality by balancing conversion rate vs the volume reaching the gate.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that usage/session‑metered gating with progressive soft‑then‑hard prompts (e.g., first 3 taps skippable, hard gate on the 4th or 5th) at tested thresholds (1/3/5/10 actions; share depth 0/1–2/5) will outperform immediate hard gating and time‑based prompting on upgrade conversion and revenue, while maintaining or improving user experience, purchase intent, and virality, because it targets engaged users at high‑value moments and nudges before enforcing a cap.

**Control:** Immediate hard gate on first attempt to use the gated feature or share (no free actions, no progressive/soft prompts, no usage/session counters).

**Variant:** Usage/session‑metered gating using instrumented counters sent as user attributes. Trigger a targeted, skippable paywall after a small number of free uses (e.g., 1 or 3; message like “Looks like you love this—unlock premium”), followed by a hard cap at a later threshold (e.g., hard gate on the 4th or 5th). Randomize thresholds to test generosity (1 vs 3 vs 5 vs 10 free actions) and include a session‑based arm (show after N sessions, e.g., 5) to compare conversion vs time‑based/session prompting. For sharing, vary gating depth (0 vs 1–2 vs 5 shares) and whether the early paywall is non‑gated vs hard‑gated before enforcing a later hard cap. Track upgrade rate/conversion, user friction, share rate, K‑factor proxies, and revenue.

## Eligibility-Driven Dynamic Paywall with Hardened Logic, Personalized Copy, and Reactivation Flow

**Description:** Test a single adaptive paywall that hardens eligibility logic and dynamically adjusts copy, badges, elements, and offers based on intro-offer eligibility, subscription state, and live user attributes. This aims to prevent accidental immediate charges, reduce purchase-sheet surprises and abandonment, maintain compliance via accurate labels, and improve conversion, ARPU, LTV, and refund behavior. The experiment also includes a dedicated no-trial reactivation paywall for ineligible/returning users, replacing generic trial messaging.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that hardening eligibility logic and using eligibility- and attribute-based dynamic content—including accurate CTA/pricing labels, a context-appropriate reactivation paywall, and trust-building microcopy like “No payment due now” shown only when a trial applies—will increase conversion and ARPU/LTV and reduce refunds and purchase-sheet surprises, because users will only see applicable offers with accurate, compliant copy and UI, avoiding logic bugs that can trigger unintended immediate charges.

**Control:** Current standard paywall flow with broadly applied trial messaging and limited targeting. Trial UI/affordances may display even when a user or product is ineligible, CTA and pricing labels are not fully populated with dynamic variables, and there is no dedicated no-trial reactivation experience. Copy is mostly static (e.g., generic ‘Try free’), elements like badges and exit offers are not reliably conditioned, and audience filters by subscription state/intro-offer eligibility may be incomplete, risking misleading labels and accidental immediate charges.

**Variant:** - Hardened eligibility logic: Validate and fix paywall visibility conditions (e.g., OR vs AND) so trial UI/affordances render only when both the product includes an introductory offer and the user is eligible; otherwise they never display, preventing unintended immediate charges.
- Accurate targeting: Apply subscription state filters (active, inactive/expired, unknown) and intro-eligibility to avoid showing the wrong offers (including transaction-abandon campaigns) and to route ineligible users to the correct experience.
- Dynamic content rules: Use dynamic JSON/editor-level rules and variables (e.g., free trial eligible, current page index, selected product) to drive copy, visibility, and CTA behavior so a single paywall adapts across states without duplicating screens and eliminates unnecessary user math/wording.
- Copy and labels: Only show ‘Try free’, ‘Free week’, or ‘start free trial’ copy when the user is eligible and an intro offer exists; otherwise show ‘unlock premium’. Populate CTAs and pricing with dynamic variables (trial days, price, eligibility) to maintain compliance and avoid misleading users.
- Trust badge: Add a small, trustworthy badge near the CTA (e.g., with a checkmark icon) stating ‘No payment due now’ only when an intro offer is available; hide it when no trial applies.
- Conditional elements: Show/hide entire sections (e.g., free-trial copy, social proof) and elements like the exit offer based on eligibility and attributes; hide trial badges when ineligible.
- Personalization: Inject live user attributes into copy (e.g., community, education, remaining likes: ‘You’re almost out—1 like left’) to increase relevance while ensuring trial-related elements are suppressed when not applicable.
- Reactivation and returning users: For inactive/expired or otherwise ineligible/returning users, remove free-trial messaging and present either a no-trial reactivation paywall or a pay-upfront intro, then compare conversion, ARPU, LTV, and refund behavior to the standard trial experience.

## Premium-first point-of-action paywall with single annual plan vs comparison-first multi-plan upfront

**Description:** Test whether leading with a premium-only paywall, delivered as a bottom-sheet at the moment a user hits a limit, and offering a single defaulted annual plan upfront (moving other plans to exit/post-onboarding) outperforms showing a standard vs premium comparison table with multiple plan options upfront. This matters because prior tests indicate multiple options reduced conversions; two-plan and even single-plan upfront flows performed better, and premium-first with careful exit handling is expected to raise ARPU and net revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a premium-first, bottom-sheet paywall shown at the point of action (referencing the user’s current task) that launches the purchase sheet directly and leads with a single annual plan—while moving other plan options behind an exit and offering a downgrade on exit—will increase direct subscriptions, overall conversions, ARPU, and net revenue compared to a comparison-first paywall with multiple plans shown upfront, because fewer choices and careful exit handling reduce friction and capture value without losing users who prefer non-premium options.

**Control:** Comparison-first add-on flow that shows a standard vs premium comparison table upfront. Multiple plan options (e.g., monthly/weekly alongside annual) are presented on the primary paywall during onboarding and paywall interactions. Bottom-sheet at the point of action is not used.

**Variant:** Premium-first flow that leads with a premium-only paywall presented as a drawer/half-sheet when a user hits a limit (e.g., out of free actions). The sheet references the user’s current task and launches the purchase sheet directly. A single, defaulted annual plan is shown upfront; other plans (e.g., monthly/weekly) are moved to exit or post-onboarding contexts. On exit, present a downgrade/alternative plan (careful exit handling).

## Annual trial vs no‑trial pricing and offer structure across plans

**Description:** Test annual plan trial vs no‑trial at specific price points alongside trial configuration across monthly and annual. This matters to balance cash‑in‑now versus LTV/retention, understand proceeds per user and commitment, and inform the offer based on cashflow needs and churn profile. Measure trial starts, trial‑to‑paid, plan mix, refunds, proceeds per user, downstream retention, and LTV. A low‑price annual with no trial and a mandatory gate may yield more committed users, better feedback loops, and in some cases higher revenue if conversion remains strong.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a no‑trial, low‑price annual with a mandatory gate will increase upfront proceeds per user, drive more committed users and better feedback loops, and can yield higher revenue if conversion remains strong; and that varying trial presence and length across monthly and annual (trial on both vs monthly‑only; 3‑day monthly vs 7‑day annual) will shift trial starts, trial‑to‑paid, plan mix, refunds, and downstream retention.

**Control:** Current trial‑based offer (status quo), i.e., the existing trial‑based annual and the current monthly/annual trial configuration.

**Variant:** Multi‑arm offer structure and pricing test: (1) Trial on both monthly and annual with annual at $29.99 with a 7‑day trial. (2) Trial only on monthly; annual is a direct purchase with no trial (hard/mandatory gate) at $19.99. (3) Trial lengths test: 3‑day trial on monthly vs 7‑day trial on annual. Compare cash‑in‑now vs LTV/retention and proceeds per user, plus trial starts, trial‑to‑paid, plan mix, refunds, and downstream retention.

## Timed sale after onboarding boosts ARPU

**Description:** Test whether presenting a limited-time discount shortly after onboarding to users who did not purchase on the initial paywall increases ARPU. Prior observation indicated an approximate 20% ARPU lift in this segment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a limited-time discount shortly after onboarding to users who did not purchase on the initial paywall will increase ARPU by around 20%.

**Control:** Users see the standard flow: an initial paywall during onboarding with no limited-time discount presented after onboarding.

**Variant:** Users who did not purchase on the initial paywall are shown a limited-time discount shortly after onboarding.

---

## Paid intro onboarding (30‑day pass or pay‑as‑you‑go months) rolling into annual vs. current free trial/straight annual

**Description:** Test replacing the current free trial/straight annual entry with a low‑cost paid intro that rolls into an annual plan. Variants include a 30‑day (one‑month) paid pass or a pay‑as‑you‑go intro (monthly for N months, e.g., 6) before moving users to annual. This matters to assess whether upfront commitment improves proceeds per user, retention, and churn, lifts trial start and trial‑to‑paid rates versus shorter free trials, and sends higher‑value events back to ad networks.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a low‑cost paid intro (either a 30‑day pass or monthly pay‑as‑you‑go for N months) that transitions to an annual plan will outperform the current shorter free trial and straight annual offering on proceeds per user, retention, and churn, and will increase trial start and trial‑to‑paid rates versus shorter free trials, because upfront commitment screens for higher‑intent users and provides higher‑value events to ad networks.

**Control:** Current onboarding: users enter via a shorter free trial (where applicable) and are then presented with a standard straight‑to‑annual plan; no paid intro passes or pay‑as‑you‑go installment options.

**Variant:** Onboarding replaces the free trial with a low‑cost paid intro that automatically moves to an annual plan: (A) a 30‑day (one‑month) paid pass that renews to annual, or (B) a pay‑as‑you‑go intro priced monthly for the first N months (e.g., 6) and then moves to annual. Monitor proceeds per user, retention, churn over time, trial start, trial‑to‑paid rates, and the presence of higher‑value events sent to ad networks.

## Broaden Paywall Coverage and Increase Exposure Frequency to Drive Trial Starts

**Description:** Test whether making the paywall easier to trigger (not buried in settings) and increasing how often users encounter it boosts trial starts. This focuses on visibility/coverage first—before any content or design optimization—while monitoring retention and engagement to avoid overwhelming users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that increasing paywall exposure frequency and ensuring broad, easy-to-trigger coverage (not buried in settings) will increase trial starts without harming retention or engagement, because higher average paywalls viewed per user correlates with more trial starts and insufficient visibility constrains impact.

**Control:** Current paywall placement and triggering as-is (existing locations and frequency), with no changes to paywall content or design.

**Variant:** Without changing paywall content or design, adjust paywall triggers to ensure broad coverage (make it easy to trigger and not buried in settings) and increase exposure frequency so more users see the paywall more often, while monitoring retention and engagement to detect signs of overwhelm.

## Annual‑First Single‑Offer Paywall with Two‑Screen Reveal and Exit‑Offer Monthly

**Description:** Test leading with a single discounted annual/long‑term plan, avoiding mixed intervals and carousels that surface monthly up front. Defer any monthly exposure to either: (a) a second screen that presents the annual plan’s discounted monthly equivalent with a clear “saved amount” notice, and (b) an exit offer that reveals monthly/no‑trial options. This aims to reduce cognitive load, prevent monthly anchoring (which can spike monthly selection ~+20%), and re‑order plan selection toward long‑term (one implementation shifted purchases to >90% long‑term vs ~60/40 prior).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with a single, discounted annual plan (60% off), avoiding mixed intervals and monthly‑first carousels, and only revealing monthly/no‑trial via exit—while using a second screen to show the annual plan’s discounted monthly equivalent and savings—will increase annual/long‑term selection and overall conversions because it reduces initial complexity, prevents upfront monthly anchoring (~+20% monthly lift when surfaced), and leverages exit offers that have shifted purchases to >90% long‑term in one implementation.

**Control:** Paywall lists multiple price intervals together on the same screen (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly) and/or uses a carousel where the monthly plan is visible or discoverable up front, allowing monthly to be selected immediately.

**Variant:** - Screen 1 (single offer): Show only the annual/long‑term plan as the primary choice, highlighted with a 60‑percent discount. Do not mix intervals on this screen; do not use a carousel that surfaces monthly. Use a focused CTA to continue.
- Screen 2 (details): Present the annual plan anchored to its discounted monthly equivalent and include a clear notice of the saved amount. The monthly plan itself remains hidden/not selectable here.
- Exit offer: If the user attempts to exit, reveal additional plans (e.g., monthly or no‑trial) as the alternative choice. Prior implementations of this pattern have re‑ordered purchases to over 90% long‑term versus about 60/40 before.

## Pricing and trial-length re-test with material price steps and annual savings presentation

**Description:** Test materially different pricing steps and trial-length combinations, presented as monthly vs. annual pairs with 30–50% annual savings and clean monthly equivalents. Re-test every 3–9 months (roughly every six months) and around seasonal shifts, starting with key markets and top traffic tiers. This matters because acquisition mix, user behavior, and product value change over time. Measure both conversion and proceeds per user.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using materially different price steps (e.g., ±$30 bands) and pairing price tests with trial-length tests—presented as monthly vs. annual options showing 30–50% annual savings and clean monthly equivalents—will increase conversion and proceeds per user, because acquisition mix, user behavior, and product value shift over time and require re-optimization. Rounding can be applied after winners are identified.

**Control:** Current pricing and trial-length settings with the existing pricing presentation unchanged (retain current price points, trial length, and any current monthly/annual configuration, savings messaging, and monthly-equivalent display).

**Variant:** Introduce materially different price steps (e.g., ±$30 bands) and vary trial length. Present price pairs (monthly vs. annual) with annual savings shown as 30–50% and display clean monthly equivalents. Prioritize key markets and top traffic tiers for the rollout. Measure both conversion and proceeds per user; consider rounding only after identifying winning configurations.

## Contextual, feature- and lifecycle-specific paywalls vs generic upgrade paywall

**Description:** Test whether replacing a single generic upgrade paywall with contextual paywalls tailored to the user’s journey, exact gated feature/action, placement, and lifecycle state increases relevance, paywall opens, and conversion (including at feature gates and trial-to-paid). Contexts include locked features/content and resource/usage limits. This matters because showing the value of the specific feature and job-to-be-done at the moment of intent has shown meaningful lifts. Trigger paywalls at limits or gates to convert engaged users while balancing free access to build habit without undermining premium value.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing contextual paywalls matched to the triggered feature/limit, placement intent, and lifecycle state (with feature-specific copy/visuals and minimal mid-task interruption) will increase paywall opens and conversion versus a generic upgrade paywall, because it increases perceived relevance, clearly demonstrates the exact value being unlocked (and included benefits), and aligns to the user’s current job-to-be-done.

**Control:** A single generic upgrade paywall reused across placements (e.g., onboarding, feature-gate, content preview, re‑engagement/“Pro” button) and for all users regardless of lifecycle state. Copy and visuals are not tied to the specific feature, trigger, or job-to-be-done; no lifecycle‑specific messaging or deep links; same one‑size‑fits‑all format and ordering everywhere.

**Variant:** Show contextual, journey- and lifecycle‑aware paywalls:
- Triggers/placements: At premium feature triggers and locked content, on resource/usage limits or ineligible actions, and across placements (onboarding vs feature‑gate vs content preview vs re‑engagement/“Pro”). Include specific gated actions (e.g., import, create, save) and selections (e.g., a specific template/theme/tool).
- Messaging/creative: Use a feature‑specific paywall whose headline, bullets, and visuals explain the value of that exact feature (name + short explanation), explicitly reflecting the trigger. List other benefits included with purchase and optionally add a feature‑specific testimonial. A feature carousel can demonstrate the capability in action. Tailor copy to the job‑to‑be‑done (e.g., post‑exam analytics vs training). Use different copy, visuals, and ordering by placement.
- Format by intent: In mid‑task/feature‑gate flows, use a minimal, contained, task‑focused modal that emphasizes immediate unlock, minimizing interruption and copy length. On re‑engagement or lower‑intent surfaces (e.g., “Pro” button), a feature carousel can outperform trial‑timeline messaging; on onboarding, trial‑first messaging can outperform.
- Lifecycle targeting: Tailor messaging by subscription state (active with auto‑renew off, grace period/billing issue, expired trial, expired subscription) and lifecycle events (e.g., declined paywall, abandoned transaction). Where relevant, include deep links to manage billing.
- Safeguard: When limits are under test, avoid referencing exact thresholds in copy.

## Design-Your-Trial: Short Free vs Low-Cost 30‑Day Paid Intro (Same Annual Renewal)

**Description:** Test presenting a two-tier choice on the paywall— a short free trial vs a low‑cost 30‑day paid introductory period—both renewing to the same annual plan (anchored to the yearly price). Across teams, this framing has yielded ~30–33% higher initial conversions, with a notable minority (~10–15%) choosing the paid option. Paid intros often show lower trial cancellation, higher trial‑to‑paid rates, improved retention quality, and better long‑term paid conversions, likely because users feel agency, can opt for a low‑risk paid intro, and get a longer evaluation window. Examples include 7 days free vs 30 days for a small fee (e.g., $5), or 3 days free vs 30 days paid.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering users a choice between a short free trial and a low‑cost, longer paid introductory period—both clearly renewing to the same annual plan—will increase initial trial starts by around 30%+, while maintaining or improving trial‑to‑paid conversion and retention (including lower cancellations), because the choice provides perceived control, a low‑risk paid alternative, and a longer evaluation window; we expect a notable minority (~10–15%) to select the paid option.

**Control:** Single-trial paywall offering one trial option with no free‑vs‑paid choice (status quo).

**Variant:** Design‑your‑trial paywall presenting two annual options side‑by‑side: (1) a short free trial (e.g., 7 days; also used as 3 days in some examples) that renews to the annual plan; and (2) a low‑cost paid introductory period (e.g., 30 days for a small upfront fee such as $5) that converts/renews to the same annual plan. Both options clearly anchor to the same annual renewal price.

## Push/Email Deep-Linked Paywalls for Win‑Backs, Upgrades, and Event Triggers

**Description:** Test whether lifecycle push and email that deep link users to specific paywall variants (or web checkout) outperform a holdout. Deep links use URL parameters (e.g., paywall=winback, offer=black_friday) to target offers like lifetime promos, exclusive discounts, or annual discounts. Applies to large legacy/lapsed lists, returning churned subscribers, free users, and event-triggered moments (app open, key engagement, achievement, trial cancellation, survey response). Ensure the in-app route matches the campaign offer, coordinate push/email cadence, use a dedicated deep-link placement, cap one-time offers to a single view, attribute via URL parameters, and support on-device QA. Web checkout paths can passively A/B test paywalls/offers and sync entitlements back to the app via magic link, enabling win‑back testing without app releases. Deep links can also originate from external web pages and can target the settings paywall to measure conversion acceleration. This removes steps, streamlines re-subscription, and can drive a measurable portion of new revenue with minimal complaints.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sending targeted deep links from push/email to specific paywalls or web checkout—aligned to user state and key events—will accelerate conversion, reactivation, and upgrades versus a holdout with no push because it eliminates an extra step, presents personalized/limited offers (e.g., lifetime, exclusive, annual), streamlines re-subscription via CRM deep links and magic links, and maintains offer consistency with accurate attribution.

**Control:** Holdout cohort receives no push; users are not deep-linked to a targeted paywall from push and proceed without the targeted push intervention.

**Variant:** Send targeted push notifications and CRM emails containing deep links (from email, push, or external web pages) with URL parameters that: open directly to a specific in‑app paywall variant (including the settings paywall) or to a web checkout that routes back via a magic link to apply entitlements; target cohorts and moments including large legacy/lapsed users, returning churned subscribers on next open, free users, and event-triggered moments (app open, key engagement, achievement, trial cancellation, survey response); coordinate push/email cadence and ensure the in‑app paywall route matches the campaign offer via a dedicated deep‑link placement; use parameters such as paywall=winback and offer=black_friday, cap one‑time/limited offers to one view per user, and attribute performance via URL parameters; passively A/B test web paywalls and offers and leverage on‑device QA to preview specific paywalls/states. Measure conversion acceleration and reactivation/upgrade rates versus the holdout.

## Two‑Stage (Soft‑First + Hard‑Later) Paywall vs Hard‑Only

**Description:** Test showing a dismissible (non‑gated) paywall at a high‑intent moment before value is revealed, then later gating core results/features with a hard paywall, versus using only a hard paywall. This aims to quantify total revenue and UX trade‑offs; teams have reported much higher conversion while preserving early UX flow with the two‑stage approach.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a two‑stage paywall (soft early + hard later) will increase conversion and preserve early UX flow versus a hard‑only gate because a dismissible prompt at a high‑intent moment primes users before value is revealed, and the hard paywall appears only when accessing core results/features. Teams have reported much higher conversion with this approach.

**Control:** Hard‑only gating: users encounter a single hard paywall that gates access to core results/features, with no prior soft prompt.

**Variant:** Two‑stage gating: first show a non‑gated (dismissible) paywall at a high‑intent moment before value is revealed; later gate core results/features with a hard paywall.

## High‑Intent Abandonment Recovery: Sequenced, Targeted Offers Across Channels

**Description:** Test a coordinated lifecycle that increases touch frequency and uses time‑ and behavior‑based triggers to recover high‑intent non‑converters who view paywalls or abandon checkout. The sequence combines immediate CRM outreach, targeted recovery paywalls, dismissal‑count–based discount escalation, rotating offers across sessions, and timed re‑offers (including a discounted annual with no trial on purchase‑sheet dismissal) to monetize reluctant users while protecting baseline ARPU and avoiding day‑0 churn. Monitor revenue lift alongside support/review sentiment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that orchestrating immediate and timed follow‑ups (push/email/in‑app) with contextual incentives—including a limited‑time discounted annual with no trial upon purchase‑sheet dismissal, incentives tailored to the abandoned product (e.g., longer trial for short‑trial abandoners or deeper discounts), escalation by paywall dismissal count, rotating offers across sessions, and a day‑10 re‑offer within a 30‑day window—will increase conversion and recover more revenue from high‑intent non‑converters because it engages quickly, matches incentives to user price sensitivity and intent, monetizes immediately, and reduces abandonment.

**Control:** Current experience without the coordinated abandonment lifecycle: standard paywall/checkout flow with no immediate recovery paywall or targeted rescue offer on purchase‑sheet dismissal, no abandoned‑paywall/app‑exit pushes, no dismissal‑count–based escalation or rotating offers, and no day‑10 timed re‑offer.

**Variant:** Eligibility: users who tap a promo and view a paywall without purchasing; users who initiate upgrade/trial and dismiss or abandon the system purchase sheet; returning non‑converters post‑onboarding.

Sequence:
1) Immediate (seconds–minutes)
- On purchase‑sheet dismissal: automatically show a targeted recovery paywall with a contextual incentive (discount or different trial) and present a limited‑time discounted annual with no trial. Tailor by abandoned product (e.g., longer trial for short‑trial abandoners or a deeper discount).
- Trigger immediate CRM outreach via push/email with a relevant nudge (limited‑time discount, extended trial, or a clear summary of exclusive benefits). If the user is still in‑app, show an in‑app message addressing likely concerns, offering a discount, alternative plans, or personalized creative that reframes value.
- If a paywall was viewed but no purchase and the app is exited, send a timely “special offer” push; also send abandoned‑cart style push during the sale window to users who tapped a promo, saw the paywall, and didn’t convert.
- Apply time‑since rules (e.g., only show a discount paywall if the user declined within the last 60 minutes).

2) Escalation by behavior
- Track paywall dismissal counts (e.g., 2, 3, 4+). Escalate to deeper discounts or lifetime offers only after repeated dismissals to protect baseline ARPU.
- If a discounted offer is declined, rotate to a different offer on a subsequent session to capture alternate price sensitivities.

3) Later sessions and reminders
- For returning non‑converters, show a limited‑time in‑session modal (e.g., 20% off).
- Post‑onboarding (e.g., session 2), present a slightly cheaper annual or a special offer to non‑converters.
- For users who opened the purchase sheet but didn’t finish, show a gentle “You didn’t finish your purchase” interstitial or push on the next session.

4) Time‑based re‑engagement window
- Re‑surface a timed offer at day 10 with a discount and track abandon‑to‑purchase conversion over a 30‑day window to assess improvement in the re‑segment acquisition.

## Paid upfront (no trial) with exit-intent short trial vs upfront free trial

**Description:** Test leading with a paid introductory/direct purchase offer and reserving a shorter free trial exclusively as an exit-intent save against immediately offering a free trial. This aims to increase the share of direct annual purchases and proceeds per user, protect UA signals and LTV, and balance monetization with risk control. Prior use of the paid-first flow yielded a high share of direct annual purchases and strong proceeds per user; monitor support/refund signals closely.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a paid introductory/direct purchase offer upfront and offering a shorter free trial only on exit intent will increase direct annual purchases and proceeds per user and protect UA signals and LTV, while keeping support/refund load within acceptable levels, compared to offering a free trial upfront.

**Control:** Upfront free trial offered as the primary path (no paid introductory offer shown first).

**Variant:** Lead with a paid introductory/direct purchase offer (no trial shown upfront). Offer a shorter free trial exclusively as an exit-intent/abandonment save. Closely monitor support/refund signals.

## Discount‑First Special‑Offer Paywalls at App Launch and Post‑Abandonment

**Description:** Test dedicated, time‑limited “special offer” paywalls and popups that emphasize discount and urgency at two moments: app launch and after checkout abandonment/cancellation. Designs are discount‑first (big, bold, gradient‑heavy visuals with prominent discount labels, minimal graphics), use scarcity framing, refresh creative for the sale (even if price is unchanged), and remain visually distinct from the main paywall. For dismissals, add a follow‑up confirm prompt to nudge reconsideration without deeper discounting. Ensure full, compliant price disclosure whenever relative savings are referenced.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that dedicated, limited‑time special‑offer experiences with discount‑first design and scarcity signals—shown at app launch and immediately after a user abandons or cancels checkout—will increase conversion and recover a meaningful share of abandoners because they focus attention on the offer/price, create urgency, intercept high‑intent users at the decision moment, refresh perceived value via new creative, and remain distinct from the main paywall.

**Control:** Current paywall and post‑abandonment flows without dedicated, time‑limited special‑offer designs; no immediate one‑time exit offer after closing the purchase sheet or canceling system checkout; no follow‑up confirm prompt on dismiss; standard brand/feature‑led visuals as currently implemented.

**Variant:** Implement special‑offer experiences across two triggers:

1) App launch
- Show a sale‑specific, time‑limited paywall centered on the user’s limited‑time win and discount.
- Use discount‑first visuals: big, bold, gradient‑heavy blocks with prominent discount labels; minimal/playful brand graphics are deprioritized.
- Refresh visuals and messaging to signal a special offer (even if the underlying price did not change).
- Ensure full, compliant price disclosure.

2) Post‑abandonment / checkout cancellation
- If a user closes the purchase sheet or cancels the system purchase flow, immediately present a visually distinct, limited‑time exit offer using scarcity signals (e.g., “one‑time special,” “won’t be available later”).
- Offer a single‑minded discount (e.g., 30% off annual) limited to a one‑time campaign, or present a temporary discount on a quarterly plan, or a lower‑priced option.
- For abandonment‑recovery paywalls, deprioritize feature lists; use concise, offer‑centric messaging and clean visuals. Optional elements: a countdown timer and a short, authentic brand message.
- On dismiss, show a follow‑up prompt asking the user to confirm exiting the deal (to nudge reconsideration without deeper discounting).
- Keep the exit‑offer design visually distinct from the main paywall to avoid banner blindness.
- Ensure full, compliant price disclosure whenever relative savings are referenced.

## Premium-first default to higher-value, highest-LTV plan vs standard two-tier paywall

**Description:** Test defaulting to the higher-value plan and leading with a premium-only view (with a lower-tier exit) versus a standard two-tier presentation. Incorporate a segmented toggle between Premium and Premium-Plus that defaults to Premium-Plus and visually indicates a discount, and preselect the highest-LTV, least-confusing plan (e.g., individual annual vs group). Measure initial conversion, trial-to-paid (if any), proceeds per user, retention, plan mix, refunds, support burden, and churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that defaulting customers to the higher-value tier and leading with a premium-only flow—with a lower-tier exit, a segmented toggle defaulted to Premium-Plus with a visible discount, and preselecting the highest-LTV, least-confusing plan (e.g., individual annual over group)—will increase initial conversion, trial-to-paid (if any), proceeds per user, and retention; shift plan mix toward higher tiers without increasing refunds; and reduce support burden and churn, compared to a standard side-by-side two-tier paywall with the current default.

**Control:** Current paywall showing both tiers side-by-side; current default selection (typically the standard/lower tier); no premium-only introductory screen and no lower-tier exit flow; no segmented toggle defaulting to Premium-Plus or explicit discount indicator; plan type preselection follows the current baseline (e.g., individual vs group as is).

**Variant:** Premium-first purchase flow that initially shows only the higher tier with a lower-tier exit offer; includes a segmented control between Premium and Premium-Plus that defaults to Premium-Plus and visually indicates a discount; and preselects the highest-LTV, least-confusing plan (e.g., individual annual vs group), if multiple tiers/plans exist.

## Transaction-Abandonment Rescue Offers (Post–Purchase-Sheet Only, Scoped by Placement)

**Description:** Test showing a targeted second-chance offer only after users open and then cancel/dismiss the native purchase sheet. The offer can be a time-limited small discount (e.g., “$2 off if you buy now”), a lower-priced option, a discounted price paired with the standard trial, or alternate value (longer trial, discounted annual/yearly, or paid intro). Trigger this only for selected placements (e.g., onboarding) via a filter (e.g., presented_by_event_name). Also right-size discounts (e.g., 15% vs 50%) to avoid harming revenue quality. This aims to rescue high-intent users without cheapening the product for everyone.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that triggering a tailored rescue offer only after genuine purchase intent (opening the system purchase sheet) and subsequent abandonment will increase checkout completion versus no post-abandon offer, while avoiding the perception of blanket discounts. We also believe right-sizing discount depth (e.g., 15% vs 50%) and scoping by placement will lift conversions without degrading revenue quality.

**Control:** No post-abandonment rescue offer. Users who cancel or dismiss the purchase sheet return to the standard experience, and no discounts are shown on initial paywall close.

**Variant:** When the system purchase sheet is opened and then canceled/dismissed (transaction abandoned), immediately present a targeted offer—only for selected placements (e.g., onboarding) using a filter such as presented_by_event_name. Allowed offers include: (1) a time-limited small discount (e.g., $2 off), (2) a lower-priced option, (3) a discounted price paired with the standard trial, or (4) an alternate value offer such as a longer trial, discounted annual/yearly, or a paid intro. Test discount depth (e.g., 15% vs 50%) to right-size conversion vs. revenue quality. Do not show any discount on initial paywall close.

## Decoy and Lifetime Anchor Paywall Test to Boost Annual Uptake

**Description:** Test a paywall configuration that uses decoy pricing and lifetime price anchoring to make the annual plan the obvious choice. The experiment introduces a higher‑priced lifetime plan as an anchor and a shorter‑term plan (weekly/monthly/quarterly) as a decoy, with annual set as the default. This matters because high‑priced decoys and anchors have repeatedly increased selection of the middle (annual) plan, can maximize conversions and upfront revenue, and—when weekly churn is elevated—using monthly instead of weekly as the decoy can improve LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a higher‑priced lifetime plan above a discounted annual plan and pairing annual with a high‑priced, no‑trial shorter‑term decoy (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) will steer a larger share of users to annual (aiming for >90% selections), increase overall conversions and upfront revenue, and—where weekly churn is elevated—monthly as the decoy will improve LTV versus weekly, because price anchoring and decoy pricing make the annual plan feel like the best value while removing trials from shorter terms reduces their appeal.

**Control:** Current paywall with a normal pricing layout, no explicit high‑priced decoy, and no lifetime plan shown as a price anchor; existing plan mix and trial setup unchanged.

**Variant:** Paywall uses an anchoring + decoy framework centered on annual: 1) Default to the annual plan with a free trial, highlighting 30–50% annual savings. 2) Display a higher‑priced lifetime plan above the discounted annual plan to act as a price anchor (also test lifetime shown vs hidden to isolate anchor effects). 3) Include exactly one shorter‑term plan as a decoy with no trial, priced at a relatively high effective monthly rate to steer selection to annual. 4) Compare which secondary plan best anchors annual and maximizes conversions and upfront revenue: Yearly + Monthly vs Yearly + Quarterly; use Monthly instead of Weekly as the decoy when weekly churn is elevated. 5) Weekly or lifetime plans can function as decoys; adding a high‑priced third option in a three‑plan set is expected to increase the middle (annual) plan’s purchases. Target outcome: keep >90% of selections on annual while improving overall monetization.

## 3‑day vs 7‑day Free Trial Across Monthly and Annual Plans

**Description:** Test the impact of shortening the free trial from 7 days to 3 days on both monthly and annual plans. Prior tests indicate 3‑day trials increased trial‑to‑paid and boosted ARPU ~10–15% without increasing early cancellations, with plan mix largely unchanged. Shorter trials can add urgency, improve intent quality, and may reduce day‑0/1 cancellations by setting tighter expectations; they also accelerate revenue timing and ROAS feedback. However, some results showed 7‑day improved trial‑to‑paid in aggregate, while 3‑day produced faster revenue but more cancels, with outcomes varying by market/locale. Longer trials can increase trial start rate, so track start rate alongside monetization outcomes. Measure: trial start rate, trial‑to‑paid, day‑0/1 and overall cancels, refunds, ARPU, plan mix, and day‑30 retention, segmented by plan and market.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a 3‑day trial (vs 7‑day) on both monthly and annual plans will increase trial‑to‑paid and raise ARPU by ~10–15% without increasing early cancellations, because the shorter window adds urgency, improves intent quality, and sets tighter expectations; it will also accelerate revenue timing/ROAS feedback, with minimal impact on plan mix.

**Control:** 7‑day free trial on both monthly and annual plans (status quo). No other changes. Track trial start rate, trial‑to‑paid, day‑0/1 and overall cancels, refunds, ARPU, plan mix, and day‑30 retention by market/locale.

**Variant:** 3‑day free trial on both monthly and annual plans. Ensure matching 3‑day variants exist for both plans before testing. Track the same metrics and segment by market/locale to capture potential regional differences and any trade‑off between faster revenue and cancellations.

## Intercept cancellation with pause, tailored discount, and plan swap options

**Description:** Test replacing a direct store “Manage/Cancel” deep‑link with in‑app cancellation screens that capture reason and present tailored save options—pause, temporary discount via a win‑back paywall, or plan swap/downgrade within the same subscription group. This approach gives more control than stock store flows, helps retain at‑risk users without deep discounting the base, and is especially useful when not using native in‑app purchases or when web billing is controlled.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing the direct store cancellation path with in‑app screens that ask for a reason and offer a tailored save (pause, temporary discount win‑back paywall, or swap to a cheaper annual or monthly plan within the same subscription group, plus a clearly visible monthly downgrade option) will reduce churn and increase plan switches because it slows churn and captures last‑minute saves while preserving base pricing.

**Control:** Current flow: a direct “Manage subscription” deep‑link to the native store manage page with no in‑app intercept. No reason capture, no pause option, no tailored discount/save offers, no win‑back paywall, and no explicit configuration to ensure a monthly downgrade is visible on the native manage page. Web‑billed users follow the standard cancel path without a pause option.

**Variant:** Intervened flow: when a user taps “Manage/Cancel,” show in‑app screens that (1) ask the cancellation reason, (2) present tailored alternatives, then (3) offer a “No thanks, cancel” button that deep‑links to the store. Tailored alternatives include: • Pause option (e.g., 3 months) with auto‑resume when billing is controlled on web/outside native IAP. • A win‑back paywall offering a temporary lower price or a plan swap within the same subscription group, including a cheaper annual or monthly option. Ensure a monthly plan is available and visible in the native subscription manage page to catch annual users attempting to cancel. Track product switches within the same subscription group.

---

## Lifecycle and Subscription-State Segmentation vs Generic Messaging

**Description:** Run a controlled test comparing targeted lifecycle journeys and state-based win‑back/paywall offers to one‑size‑fits‑all campaigns to assess impact on conversion and reactivation. Segments span lifecycle stages (new, activated, churned, win‑back, declined paywall, abandoned checkout) and subscription states (expired trial, expired paid, never trialed, auto‑renew off, billing issue). Cohorts are targeted via entitlements or backend properties.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that lifecycle‑ and subscription‑state–segmented campaigns with tailored incentives (e.g., longer trial for “needed more time,” discount for “price too high,” feature‑focused for “product not meeting needs”), switching returning/expired users from free trials to pay‑upfront intros or full‑price offers, and state‑based paywalls with deep links to manage billing or re‑subscribe will increase conversion and reactivation rates versus generic messaging.

**Control:** One‑size‑fits‑all blasts and generic paywalls shown to all users. Reactivation relies on free trials. No segmentation by lifecycle stage or subscription state (expired trial, expired paid, never trialed, auto‑renew off, billing issue). No deep links for billing management or re‑subscribe flows.

**Variant:** Implement lifecycle‑segmented journeys for new, activated, churned, win‑back, declined paywall, and abandoned checkout. Segment app‑open or gated prompts and paywalls by subscription state: expired trial, expired paid, never trialed, auto‑renew off, and billing issue. For returning/expired users, replace free‑trial reactivation with pay‑upfront intro or full‑price offers tailored to state. Offer state‑appropriate incentives (e.g., longer trial, discount, or feature‑focused messaging aligned to the user’s reason). Include deep links to manage billing or re‑subscribe. Target cohorts using entitlements or backend properties.

## Instrument checkout funnel and recover high‑abandon checkouts with exit paywall + targeted push

**Description:** Test whether instrumenting the checkout funnel and deploying targeted abandonment offers can recover a large share of lost purchases. Expect a high abandonment rate (~60%) of initiated purchases; track checkout starts, abandonments, failures, and conversions by placement to identify where abandonment is highest. Use these insights to prioritize transaction‑abandonment discount flows and an exit paywall plus targeted push in high‑abandon segments. If abandonments are not material, deprioritize this effort.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that instrumenting the checkout funnel and deploying an exit paywall plus transaction‑abandonment discount flows and targeted push in placements with the highest abandonment will increase completed purchases and revenue, because ~60% of initiated purchases are typically abandoned and targeted interventions at high‑abandon points recover drop‑offs.

**Control:** Current checkout experience with no exit paywall, no transaction‑abandonment discount flows, and no targeted push to abandoners; no placement‑specific targeting of offers.

**Variant:** Instrument the checkout funnel to track starts, abandonments, failures, and conversions by placement. In placements with the highest abandonment, introduce an exit paywall when users attempt to leave checkout and trigger transaction‑abandonment discount flows and targeted push to abandoners.

---

## Blend capped subscription credits with paid packs and a “Subscribe & Save” upsell

**Description:** Test combining capped subscription credits for high variable‑cost features (e.g., AI usage) with additional paid credit packs, and adding a “subscribe and save” upsell on one‑time credit/pack purchase screens (e.g., renders, textures, recognitions). This aims to shift à la carte buyers toward subscriptions, bundling consumption into recurring revenue and increasing LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that capping subscription credits and offering paid credit packs, paired with a “subscribe and save” upsell on credit/pack paywalls that shows savings versus buying à la carte, will move one‑time purchasers to subscriptions, bundle usage into recurring revenue, and raise LTV.

**Control:** Current experience for credit/pack purchases as is, with existing subscription setup and credit/pack purchase modals that do not include a “subscribe and save” upsell.

**Variant:** For high variable‑cost features: 1) cap subscription credits and offer additional paid credit packs; 2) on credit/pack purchase modals (e.g., renders, textures, recognitions), add a clear option to subscribe instead with “subscribe and save” messaging that shows savings versus à la carte, including on the pack paywall.

---

## Targeted Introductory Discount That Renews to Standard Price

**Description:** Test a conditional introductory discount for the coaching plan, presented as a paywall/campaign variation to lower the entry barrier for price‑sensitive segments. The intro offer is time‑bounded (e.g., one‑time $25 instead of $50, or 25% off the first year) and renews at the full standard price to avoid lifetime discounts and price leakage. Use discounted intro in place of trials or paid intro periods. The goal is to drive initial adoption and later cross‑sell the standard plan, while protecting long‑term ARPU. Note: in at least one case, a straight discounted year outperformed an intro+standard renewal, so rigorous A/B testing is essential.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a conditional introductory discount (e.g., $25 vs $50 one‑time or 25% off the first year) that renews at the standard price and replaces trials/paid intro will increase initial conversion among price‑sensitive users without eroding long‑term ARPU, because it reduces upfront friction while avoiding permanent discounting.

**Control:** Standard, non‑discounted coaching plan pricing shown on the current paywall with no introductory discount, trial, or paid intro period.

**Variant:** Show a targeted introductory discount for the coaching plan as a paywall/campaign variation for price‑sensitive segments: offer either a one‑time intro price (e.g., $25 instead of $50) or a first‑year discount (e.g., 25% off the first year), with automatic renewal at the full standard price thereafter; no trial or paid intro. After the intro period, cross‑sell the standard plan.

---

## Limit paywall to two plans (avoid a third option)

**Description:** Test the impact of simplifying plan choices. Adding a third plan previously reduced direct subscriptions and did not improve revenue. Two plans—one with a trial and one without—consistently performed best; in many cases, a single plan upfront with the alternate offered on exit worked even better.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the third plan option and offering only two plans (one with a trial and one without) will increase direct subscriptions without reducing revenue. In many cases, a single plan upfront with the alternate offered on exit may outperform two options.

**Control:** Paywall presents three plan options.

**Variant:** Paywall presents two plan options: one with a trial and one without.

---

## Price weekly plan close to monthly or use as an anchor to protect ARPU

**Description:** Test the impact of avoiding a deeply discounted weekly plan. Prior observation: a weekly plan priced substantially below the monthly increased trial starts but delivered lower ARPU and did not catch up via renewals after multiple weeks. This experiment evaluates whether repositioning the weekly plan mitigates ARPU loss while preserving trial starts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that positioning the weekly plan close to the monthly price or using it as an anchor (not a true lower price) will maintain trial starts and yield higher ARPU than a deeply discounted weekly plan, because the lower weekly price boosts trials but depresses revenue and renewals do not make up the gap.

**Control:** Weekly plan offered at a substantially lower effective price than the monthly plan.

**Variant:** Weekly plan priced close to the monthly plan or presented as an anchor (not a true lower price).

---

## Short-trial Weekly Subscription vs. Existing Plans

**Description:** Test whether introducing a weekly subscription with a short trial (e.g., 3-day) can become a top earner by delivering strong proceeds per user and competitive realized LTV over a year, rivaling yearly plan value for certain audiences.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a weekly subscription with a short trial (e.g., 3-day) will result in strong proceeds per user and competitive realized LTV over a year—rivaling yearly plan value for certain audiences—because short-trial weekly subscriptions have delivered these outcomes.

**Control:** Current subscription offering without a short-trial weekly plan.

**Variant:** Introduce a weekly subscription option with a short trial (e.g., 3-day).

---

## Segment and Optimize Paywalls by Lifecycle Stage (Onboarding, Post‑Onboarding/In‑App, Returning/Expired)

**Description:** Test separating onboarding, post‑onboarding/in‑app, and returning/expired paywalls into distinct campaigns and placements with dedicated audiences, tests, and reporting. Optimize messaging, design, pricing, and intervals independently per stage. For post‑onboarding, create distinct placements for all gated features and optionally keep multiple feature‑level triggers but group them under a single campaign to compare placement performance and learn where upgrades originate. For returning/expired users, use dedicated placements and offers (e.g., discounts, extended trials) and optionally trigger win‑back offers only after the 2nd or 3rd exposure. This matters because users have different knowledge, context, and intent at each stage, and onboarding/splash users often need different creative, structure, and offers than in‑app or re‑engagement placements.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that separating paywalls into distinct campaigns and placements for onboarding, post‑onboarding/in‑app, and returning/expired users—tailoring messaging, design, pricing, offer timing/intervals, and grouping post‑onboarding gated triggers under one campaign—will outperform using the same paywall across contexts and improve clarity of where upgrades originate, because users have different knowledge, context, and intent at each stage and placements perform differently.

**Control:** A single/shared paywall and combined campaign used across onboarding and post‑onboarding/in‑app contexts (and without distinct returning/expired placements), with the same audiences, messaging, design, pricing, intervals, and separate gated triggers not grouped for cross‑placement comparison.

**Variant:** Create distinct campaigns and placements by stage: (1) Onboarding/splash: optimized independently from the rest of the app for lower‑context users. (2) Post‑onboarding/in‑app and gated features: create distinct placements; keep multiple feature‑level triggers but group them under a single campaign to compare placement performance and learn upgrade origins. (3) Returning/expired users: separate placements and audiences with stage‑specific offers (e.g., discounts, extended trials) and optionally trigger win‑back offers only after the 2nd or 3rd exposure. Optimize and report on each stage independently, with messaging, design, pricing, and intervals tailored to that stage.

---

## Age-based pricing and discount segmentation for annual and lifetime plans

**Description:** Test age-based price segmentation across cohorts (e.g., under-25, under-28, 30+, 35–44) for both annual and lifetime offers. Route users via an age user attribute set before the paywall so the correct products/prices render. Prior tests indicate revenue improved with this split, older cohorts often accept higher prices and/or convert more, and over-30 users purchased significantly more expensive plans. Retest regularly to keep pricing aligned. Measure conversion, trial-to-paid, ARPU, total revenue, and user growth to ensure we optimize upfront ARPU without depressing conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing lower prices to younger cohorts (e.g., under-25/under-28) and higher prices to older cohorts (e.g., 30+, 35–44), plus applying a small first-time discount only to users over 28, will increase ARPU and total revenue (including optimizing upfront ARPU on lifetime offers) without depressing conversion or user growth, because older cohorts demonstrate higher willingness to pay and younger cohorts are more price-sensitive.

**Control:** Uniform pricing and discount rules for all users regardless of age: the same annual and lifetime prices are shown to everyone, with no age-based routing or discounts; the paywall does not depend on an age attribute.

**Variant:** Age-based segmentation with cohort-specific prices and discount rules. Implementation: set the age user attribute before triggering the paywall and route users to age-specific products/prices. Cohort treatment: (a) under-25: test lower price points; (b) under-28: offer a discounted plan; (c) over-28: offer a higher price plan plus a small first-time discount that is not offered to under-28; (d) 30+ and 35–44: test higher price points to probe greater willingness to pay. Apply this across both annual and lifetime price points, running the same price variants within each cohort to identify winners. Compare conversion, trial-to-paid, ARPU, and total revenue, and validate impact on user growth; retest regularly.

---

## Multi-page narrative paywall (with trial education) vs single-page across key placements

**Description:** Compare the current single-screen paywalls to a guided multi-page narrative that separates trial education from plan selection. Run at the end of onboarding, post-exam, and when a locked feature is tapped (feature-gate). Measure initial conversion (trial starts), trial-to-paid conversion, proceeds per user, cancellations (including day-0/1), and refunds. Prior observations indicate multi-page flows and trial timelines can reduce cancellations; this test quantifies impact while holding price constant.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a multi-page narrative flow—sequencing value and benefits, proof, and an explicit trial reminder/timeline before compliant pricing—will increase initial conversion and proceeds per user, and reduce early cancellations/refunds versus a single-screen paywall, because it clarifies value and trial expectations and matches user intent at onboarding, post-exam, and feature-gate moments.

**Control:** Current single-screen paywalls, shown: (1) at the end of onboarding and post-exam as the existing single-page/hard paywall with current pricing, and (2) at feature-gate as a single, high-focus screen leading with the job-to-be-done for the locked capability. Trial details and pricing are combined on one page; no dedicated trial timeline or multi-step narrative. Pricing is identical to the variant.

**Variant:** A multi-page narrative paywall (2–4 screens) using the same price as control and compliant pricing: (1) Intro/value and benefits with a prominent “try free” call-to-action; (2) Features and social proof (may present features via a modern carousel); (3) Trial education with an explicit reminder/promise and a visual trial timeline; (4) Plan selection and pricing, optionally with a trial toggle. At minimum, trial education and plan selection are split across separate steps. Shown at the same placements as control (end of onboarding, post-exam, and on locked feature access).

---

## Multi‑page paywall narrative with free first step, reminder reassurance, and final social proof + pricing

**Description:** Test replacing a single dense paywall with a 3–4 step narrative (often during onboarding) that sequences value → reassurance → pricing/timeline → social proof. This approach uses a fixed footer CTA and progress-only CTAs on early pages, reduces cognitive load, improves clarity/scannability, and has repeatedly increased initial conversion and trial‑to‑paid conversion while reducing day‑0 cancellations by building trust before pricing. It is compliant when the final page presents the actual price/CTA.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a multi‑page paywall beginning with a non‑transactional “Try it free/Continue for $0.00” step, explicitly reassuring users that “We’ll remind you before your trial ends” (with a clear timeline), and ending with bento‑style social proof on the purchase screen will increase initial conversion and trial‑to‑paid conversion and reduce day‑0 cancellations, because it reduces information overload, builds trust before pricing, and keeps focus via a fixed footer with progress CTAs. Bento‑style social proof on the final screen has outperformed timeline visuals.

**Control:** A single, long paywall screen that combines value proposition, features, pricing, and purchase in one page. No dedicated reminder/reassurance step, no progressive multi‑page narrative, and no fixed‑footer progression; purchase occurs on the same screen.

**Variant:** A multi‑page, fixed‑footer flow with one clear message per screen and app visuals:
- Page 1 (Value/Promise): Core value proposition and what users will achieve during the trial; optionally who it’s for. Include product visuals/video. CTA: “Try it free” or “Continue for $0.00” that advances forward only (no purchase).
- Page 2 (Reassurance + Timeline/Features): Explicit reassurance: “We’ll remind you before your free trial ends” (e.g., two days before). Show a simple trial timeline with the reminder. Optionally include rotating feature cards/carousel or short screen recordings. Optionally schedule a local notification for the reminder.
- Page 3 (Pricing/Plan Preview): Present compliant pricing and trial timeline confirmation; preview plan options (simplified/expandable comparison). Do not transact yet.
- Page 4 (Decision): Final purchase screen with plan selection and CTA that displays the actual price. Place social proof here (ratings, counts, testimonials); use bento‑style social proof, which has outperformed timeline visuals. Progress CTAs on earlier pages only move users forward; purchase occurs only on the final page.

## Reduce checkout abandonment with copy clarity, annual default, and immediate abandoner offers

**Description:** Test whether clarifying plan trials, switching the default plan to annual, and triggering tailored recovery offers on Apple purchase-sheet close improves checkout conversion. This matters because funnels have shown extreme drop-offs (e.g., ~10:1 starts:completes). Healthy benchmarks include roughly half of purchase‑sheet opens completing and a starts:completes ratio closer to ~2:1. Instrument the funnel (started, abandoned, converted) to quantify drop-off and to trigger post-abandon offers. If completion dips (e.g., below ~50%) or abandonment is high (~60%+ to ~80%), investigate issues like price mismatches, eligibility errors, or confusing paywall copy and prioritize recovery flows.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that (a) adding a clear “No trial” callout on the monthly/weekly plan when it lacks a trial, (b) switching the default plan selection to annual, and (c) immediately presenting a tailored offer (e.g., lifetime instead of monthly, or annual with trial) when the Apple purchase sheet closes without completion will reduce mistaken taps and recover abandons, increasing the % of purchase‑sheet opens that complete toward ~50% and improving the starts:completes ratio toward ~2:1.

**Control:** Current checkout and paywall experience: existing plan copy without an explicit “No trial” label on the monthly/weekly plan; current default plan selection unchanged; no immediate, tailored follow‑up offer when the Apple purchase sheet is closed without completing the transaction; existing tracking of checkout events as currently implemented.

**Variant:** Enhanced recovery flow: (1) Add an explicit “No trial” label on the monthly/weekly CTA when that plan has no trial and the annual plan does. (2) Switch the default plan selection to the annual plan. (3) Detect a purchase‑sheet open that closes without completion (Apple sheet close) and immediately present a tailored follow‑up offer (e.g., lifetime instead of monthly, or an annual plan with a trial). Instrument and monitor started vs abandoned vs converted, tracking improvements toward ~50% purchase‑sheet completion and a ~2:1 starts:completes ratio.

## Annual-first paywall default with savings anchors and secondary monthly access

**Description:** Test defaulting the highest-LTV plan (typically annual) while still showing monthly to anchor value. Prior insights indicate that showing both plans with annual preselected improves trust, can lift overall conversion, increases annual mix, and reduces accidental taps and purchase abandonment—especially when annual includes a trial or compelling value framing. Savings cues (e.g., Save X%, crossed-out 12× monthly, monthly-equivalent price) further bias toward annual, while keeping monthly less prominent or behind a discreet “View all plans” link reduces choice overload yet still captures price-sensitive users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that pre-selecting the annual/highest-LTV plan and anchoring it against monthly with clear savings/value messaging will increase the share of annual selections, maintain or improve overall conversion, and reduce purchase abandonment because defaults strongly steer plan mix, visible comparisons boost perceived savings and trust, and de-emphasizing lower-commitment plans avoids accidental low-LTV choices and churn seen with weekly defaults.

**Control:** Existing paywall where annual is not preselected (e.g., monthly/weekly default or equal prominence), monthly is presented prominently on the main step, and there is no explicit savings anchor (no Save X%, crossed-out 12× monthly, or monthly-equivalent price). Lower-commitment plans are readily visible on the main view.

**Variant:** Two-plan layout with annual as the default on the final purchase step: show annual and monthly side-by-side with annual preselected and ensure the main CTA purchases the currently selected plan. Display savings/value anchors for annual: a prominent Save X% badge, crossed-out 12× monthly price, and the monthly-equivalent price for the annual plan. Keep monthly available but less prominent or behind a discreet “View all plans” link to reduce choice overload; offer additional/lower-commitment plans via “View all plans” or exit offers. Include a trial or compelling value framing on annual (monthly often without a trial). Keep the default consistent across variants and measure results to adjust defaults by market/segment. Avoid defaulting to weekly even if it increases trials, due to lower LTV from higher churn.

---

## Narrated multi‑page paywall with free‑first promise, trial reminder, and final purchase

**Description:** Test replacing the single‑page paywall with a 3–4 screen, single‑message‑per‑page flow that: (1) starts with a “free” promise (trial or gift) and a concise value prop, (2) shows key benefits with imagery (e.g., locked preview, carousel) styled like the app, (3) explains the free‑trial reminder and timeline expectations, and (4) presents pricing and the final CTA with social proof. The first screen includes a personalized greeting using state variables. Purchase selection appears only on the last page, and the close (X) is only on that page to reduce early abandonment and avoid confusion that earlier CTAs trigger a charge. Prior implementations reported higher initial conversion (e.g., ~20% → ~29%) and ~5–10 percentage‑point reductions in day‑0 cancels while maintaining trial‑to‑pay rates, likely by building pre‑payment value and clarity. Because added steps can introduce page‑to‑page drop‑off, this should be A/B tested against the current single‑page paywall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a multi‑page, single‑message paywall that leads with a free‑trial promise, narrates value with imagery/locked previews, sets expectations with a trial reminder/timeline (e.g., free for 7 days), and reserves pricing/plan selection for the final page (with social proof and the only close/X there) will increase initial conversion and reduce day‑0 cancellations (as seen ~5–10 percentage points in prior cases) without harming trial‑to‑pay, because it builds pre‑payment value and reduces confusion about being charged early.

**Control:** Current single‑page paywall presenting value, any free‑trial mention, pricing/plan options, and the primary CTA on one screen. Purchase selection is available immediately on that page; no separate trial‑reminder/timeline step, no multi‑step narrative, and no personalized greeting or feature carousel/locked preview screens.

**Variant:** A 3–4 screen paywall with one key message per page: 1) Starter/value screen: app‑styled full page with a personalized greeting (via state variables), a prominent “Try free” (or gift) promise (e.g., free for 7 days), and a concise value proposition; can include a locked preview visual. No purchase selection here. 2) Benefits/overview: “What you get” shown with imagery/screenshots and a carousel of key features. 3) Trial reassurance and expectations: explicit trial reminder and timeline (include a reminder cue, e.g., bell visual) to reduce day‑0 cancels. 4) Pricing and purchase: plans, pricing, and final CTA are only shown here; include social proof (ratings, press badges, testimonials). The close (X) is only present on this last page to reduce early abandonment and avoid confusion that earlier CTAs charge the user.

## Annual-first single-plan paywall with compliant exit offer vs “View all plans”/multi-plan upfront

**Description:** Test packaging that leads with one high-LTV plan (typically annual or premium add-on) and reveals an alternate offer only on exit versus showing multiple plans or a “View all plans” option upfront. This matters because teams reported higher proceeds per user, a shift toward annual, reduced choice overload, and incremental recapture on dismiss. The exit offer must remain review-compliant by presenting a different product (e.g., monthly/weekly/quarterly/lifetime or an altered trial) rather than a cheaper price for the same plan, and should include a clear “No thanks” and a path back to the paywall. Measure total conversion, proceeds per user, annual mix, trial-to-paid conversion, incremental recapture versus simple dismiss, and refund rate.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with a single high-LTV plan and surfacing a compliant alternate offer only upon exit will increase proceeds per user and maintain or improve the annual share—while preserving or improving net conversions and potentially lowering refunds—because it anchors users to the premium option, reduces cognitive load, guides high-intent users to the best plan, and lets price-sensitive users self-select an alternative at the point of exit without eroding value or violating platform guidelines.

**Control:** Upfront paywall shows annual with either (a) visible alternative plans (e.g., annual + monthly/quarterly) or (b) a prominent “View all plans” button to reveal alternatives. If the user taps close/dismiss, the paywall simply closes (no exit-intercept). This also covers the simple dismiss baseline used to compare against exit-modals.

**Variant:** Upfront paywall shows only one plan (e.g., annual with trial, or a premium add-on). Alternate plans are hidden initially. If the user taps close (or cancels the purchase sheet/last step), intercept with a lightweight, dismissible exit surface (bottom sheet/drawer/modal) offering a clearly different product or trial configuration, such as: monthly or weekly pass, quarterly, lifetime, a short paid pass, monthly without trial, a longer trial (e.g., 7 vs 3 or 14 days), or a discounted annual without a free trial. Optionally include plan-by-plan mapping (e.g., lead with yearly → offer weekly/monthly on exit; lead with weekly → offer a longer plan), a comparison table when downgrading from premium add-on to standard, and copy like “Not ready to commit?” or “Save X%.” Provide a clear “No thanks” that returns to the paywall, keep a hard paywall (no app progression) and only then allow full dismiss. To stay review-compliant, avoid showing a cheaper price for the same plan immediately after cancel; prefer different products or altered trials, or trigger the alternate offer after a short delay/benign in-app action if needed. Reports noted higher proceeds per user (sometimes with slightly lower overall conversion) and, in one case, a lower refund rate when offering a monthly plan without trial on exit.

## Weekly Decoy Anchor to Steer Users to Annual and Lift Proceeds

**Description:** Test presenting a high-priced, no-trial weekly plan alongside an annual plan (with trial) and emphasizing the annual’s superior value through design and weekly-equivalent pricing/savings. The goal is for the weekly option to act as a contrast anchor (not a destination), increasing annual selection rate, proceeds per user, and LTV. This experiment also assesses whether increasing the weekly price strengthens the anchor effect and whether an exit-offer weekly decoy nudges exiting users back to annual. If App Review flags prominence of weekly-equivalent pricing, fall back to showing the annual’s per-year price with the weekly-equivalent secondary. In many cases, a weekly anchor yields most purchases on annual while improving conversion due to clearer price contrast.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a non-trial weekly plan at a higher price and emphasizing the annual plan (with a trial), including weekly-equivalent and savings messaging, will increase the annual selection rate, proceeds per user, and LTV because the weekly plan will serve as a high-cost decoy anchor that makes the annual plan feel like the obvious best value. Raising the weekly price will further shift mix toward higher-LTV annuals without materially increasing weekly purchases, and an exit-offer weekly decoy will recover users by highlighting the annual plan’s savings.

**Control:** Current paywall without a weekly anchor: no high-priced weekly decoy; no annual weekly-equivalent/savings contrast; no exit-offer weekly decoy. Existing plan lineup, trials, pricing, and design remain as is.

**Variant:** - Present weekly and annual together with design that emphasizes the annual plan’s superior value so the weekly option acts as a decoy anchor rather than cannibalizing.
- Weekly plan: make it a no-trial option and price it higher to strengthen the anchor effect (e.g., offer $4.99/week, or increase an existing weekly from ~$2.99 to ~$6.99).
- Annual plan: include a free trial and display the annual’s weekly-equivalent and savings versus the weekly (e.g., $4.99/week vs $89/year → “Save 65%”; show ~$0.57/week equivalent where appropriate).
- If you currently offer a monthly plan, switch it to a weekly, no-trial plan to push more users toward annual without removing a lower-commitment choice.
- Add an exit-offer that presents a weekly option (e.g., $4.99/week) to increase perceived savings and nudge users back to selecting annual.
- Compliance fallback: if App Review flags weekly-equivalent prominence, show the annual’s per-year price as primary and place the weekly-equivalent secondary.

## Always-Visible Upgrade Paths: Main App Button + Settings Placement

**Description:** Test adding persistent, clearly labeled upgrade entry points in both the main app interface and the Settings menu to give ready-to-convert and high-intent users an immediate path to purchase, driving meaningful incremental revenue and strong conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a clear, always-visible Upgrade/Get Pro button in the main app interface and a prominent, reserved upgrade position within Settings (with a static plan card + button that opens the purchase sheet directly) will increase conversions and revenue, because users actively seeking to upgrade often go to Settings and show very high intent, and a simple direct in‑app upgrade path can boost revenue by 10–20%, even when users can still cancel.

**Control:** Existing experience without a clear, persistent Upgrade/Get Pro button in the main app interface and without a clearly labeled, reserved upgrade placement in Settings (i.e., no static plan card + button that opens the purchase sheet directly).

**Variant:** Implement both: (1) a clear and persistent, always-visible Upgrade/Get Pro button inside the main app interface for immediate purchase; and (2) a prominently labeled upgrade entry within the Settings/menu by reserving a paywall position that includes a static upgrade UI (plan card + button) that opens the purchase sheet directly to capture high-intent users.

## Cascading paywall offers by views and lifecycle with frequency capping and second‑time offers

**Description:** Test a paced, cascading paywall system that adjusts offers by total and in‑session paywall views, days since install (lifecycle), and declining purchase power—while frequency‑capping the primary paywall, rotating creative on repeat dismissals, and triggering CRM/web follow‑ups. This aims to reduce fatigue, target fence‑sitters with timely incentives, and preserve margin on high‑intent users versus showing the same offer every time.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that pacing and sequencing paywall offers based on total and session paywall views, days since install, and a declining purchase‑power signal—plus frequency capping, creative rotation, and targeted CRM/web follow‑ups—will increase acceptance and long‑term value versus showing the same offer on every view, because it matches willingness‑to‑pay over time, reduces annoyance, and reserves discounts for holdouts.

**Control:** Static paywall flow that shows the same highest‑LTV offer on every paywall view with no trial/discount. Paywall can appear on every app open (no frequency cap), with no per‑session sequencing, no immediate second‑time offer after a decline, no creative rotation on repeat dismissals, and no lifecycle segmentation. Onboarding paywalls use IAP only; no deeper discounts via web checkout. No CRM follow‑ups based on repeated paywall views. Single offer shown at a time without rotating alternatives between views.

**Variant:** Cascading, frequency‑capped, and lifecycle‑aware paywall flow:
- Frequency cap and routing: Show the main paywall at most once per 60 minutes. During the cap window, route subsequent attempts to an alternate offer (e.g., discount variant) to create a simple two‑step flow.
- Sequencing by total paywall views: For the first 3 views, show the highest‑LTV product with no trial. After N views, introduce a small trial or alternate incentive. After 4–8 total views, trigger a discounted offer (e.g., 25% off first year) targeting fence‑sitters.
- Immediate second‑time offer: If the initial full‑price offer is declined, present a second‑time alternative (e.g., different discount or free trial) to lift conversion while preserving first‑exposure full‑price potential.
- Per‑session orchestration: Track session paywall view count; within a session, show the initial paywall first, then a discount on the second gated action.
- Lifecycle segmentation and timing: Use days since install and total paywall views to bucket users (e.g., new <1 day, warm <5 days, cold >7 days; or <5 total views). Show higher‑LTV offers early (e.g., standard annual) and progressively introduce lower‑LTV discounts as users age (e.g., after two weeks). Create a discount waterfall over time (e.g., daily for 7 days, converging to the cheapest plan by day 7). Layer seasonal promotions later in the lifecycle.
- Purchase‑power automation: Adjust the timing/size of discounts as a user’s purchase‑power score declines over time (more paywall views, longer time since install), instead of fixed calendar delays.
- Creative rotation: After the 2nd/3rd dismissal, rotate to a different paywall variant/new creative to combat fatigue.
- Channel and CRM follow‑ups: Keep onboarding paywalls on IAP; as users continue to decline over time, offer deeper discounts via web checkout to preserve proceeds. Track users with multiple paywall views and no purchase; send surveys to uncover objections and deliver tailored incentives (trial/discount). Align outreach with push/email; note teams observed post‑day‑7 push loses impact.
- Presentation mode: Show one offer at a time and rotate on revisit (sequential), rather than presenting multiple offers side‑by‑side.

## Personalized, Attribute‑Driven Paywalls vs Generic

**Description:** Test whether deeply personalized paywalls—driven by onboarding answers, user goals/motivations, custom attributes, early actions, and journey/audience context—outperform a single generic paywall. Personalization spans copy, visuals, plan configuration/order/pricing, trial emphasis, and testimonials. Prior experiments noted higher revenue per user for guided‑plan branches and teams reported survey‑to‑paywall routing can improve plan matching and ARPU. Measure lift for key cohorts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that paywalls personalized using declared goals/motivations, user attributes, and onboarding/journey context will increase conversion and average revenue per user versus a generic paywall because they present value props, visuals, plans, trials, and testimonials that directly match each user’s intent, progress, and context (e.g., guided‑plan vs competitive paths, new vs experienced users).

**Control:** One generic paywall for all users: generic goal statements and copy; standard plan ordering and pricing; single, non‑segmented trial; static, non‑user‑specific imagery; no personalized testimonials; no routing/branching from onboarding; no attribute‑based upsells or dynamic prompts; no audience‑specific adaptations beyond basic translation.

**Variant:** A fully personalized paywall experience using declared and observed data:
- Copy and trial timeline messaging personalized with motivations/goals from onboarding (e.g., “Become a better [goal]”, specific goals like “Lose 12 pounds by July”).
- Value props and feature ordering tailored to onboarding responses and early actions.
- Dynamic attribute injection in text/imagery via templating ({{variable}}): role type (e.g., player/coach), strength level, compliance status, thresholds achieved (e.g., “Only 1 like left”), recommended level, phone, location, age, subscription status.
- Audience/journey‑aligned content and flows: adapt images, copy, and plan configuration by segment and event path; ask 1–2 onboarding questions (e.g., personal vs professional use; goals) and route to a tailored paywall with different tier emphasis, messaging, or trial; align to onboarding path (guided plan vs competitive progress) and intent (e.g., new users: guided‑plan messaging and social proof; experienced users: competitive/progress framing).
- Plan presentation adjustments: featured plans, plan order, and pricing tailored per segment; offers based on measured thresholds or recommended level.
- Visual personalization with user content: render the user’s latest creation/edited item in the paywall header via a dynamic URL parameter; preview premium effects on their own content.
- Attribute‑based targeting and upsells (e.g., resistance‑band recommendation) and audience filtering.
- Testimonials mapped to the user’s stated goal/intent.
- Localization beyond translation with audience‑specific images/copy/plan configuration.

## Paid Intro Pass (1-month or short pay‑as‑you‑go) as Exit/Rescue Offer that Auto‑Renews to Annual

**Description:** Test introducing a low‑cost paid introductory pass—either a 30‑day paid month or a short pay‑as‑you‑go period—that auto‑renews to the annual plan. Surface it as an exit offer and as a rescue to users who dismiss checkout, and optionally alongside the yearly plan with a free trial to create a perceived choice. Compare performance against standard offers and alternative exit options (monthly without trial, weekly, lifetime, discounted annual, or an extended free trial). This aims to reduce upfront friction, raise overall conversions and proceeds per user, and can sometimes push users back to the annual trial. Note: this path can be slower to evaluate but may yield higher net revenue. Adhere to platform constraints (e.g., intro price ≤ annual/12; App Store rules like annual price not lower than 12× monthly; iOS intro duration limits).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a low‑priced paid first month (e.g., $6 for the first month) or a short pay‑as‑you‑go intro (e.g., $15/month for the first six months), which auto‑renews to an annual plan and is presented on exit/dismissal or alongside the annual trial, will increase overall conversions and net revenue per user because it lowers initial commitment while maintaining annual ARPU. We also expect it to sometimes push users back to the annual trial versus free‑trial or standard annual alternatives.

**Control:** Current paywall/checkout experience without a paid one‑month (or short pay‑as‑you‑go) introductory pass that auto‑renews to annual. Users see the standard annual plan (with any existing free trial, if applicable) and current exit flow without a paid pass or extended‑trial rescue offers.

**Variant:** Introduce a paid introductory offer that auto‑renews to annual, and test it in the following ways: (1) Offer formats: • 30‑day paid pass (one‑month intro) priced at or below the allowed cap (≤ annual/12). • Pay‑as‑you‑go intros such as $6 for the first month then auto‑renew to annual, or $15/month for the first six months then auto‑renew to annual. (2) Placement: • Show on exit as an alternative to abandoning the paywall. • Present as a rescue option to users who dismiss checkout. • Optionally present alongside the yearly plan with a free trial to create perceived choice. (3) Alternative exit‑offer comparisons: • A/B test against monthly (no trial), weekly, lifetime, discounted annual (calibrate discount depth, e.g., 15% vs 50%), and an extended free trial. Monitor cannibalization vs net lift in proceeds per user. (4) Measurement: Track short‑term conversion, trial‑to‑paid style outcomes for rescues, medium‑term retention/cancellations, churn, and net revenue per user; observe whether the paid pass pushes users back to the annual plan. (5) Compliance: Respect App Store constraints, including intro price ≤ annual/12, guidance such as annual price not lower than 12× monthly, and iOS intro duration limits.

## Event-driven, per-feature paywall placements vs. a generic paywall

**Description:** Test replacing a single generic paywall with granular, event-driven placements and per-feature targeting. The goal is to attribute opens/conversions to specific features and moments, tailor experiences and caps per placement, avoid audience conflicts via ordered evaluation, and enable rapid routing of traffic and A/B tests without future app updates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that driving paywalls from distinct, per-feature/per-moment events with ordered audience evaluation and targeted paywalls will improve upgrade performance and reveal which features and contexts drive opens and conversions, because the paywall will be shown at precise, high-intent moments with placement-specific logic and clearer attribution.

**Control:** - Show a single generic paywall everywhere.
- Use one generic paywall event (optionally with a ‘source’ property) rather than distinct events per placement.
- Rely on a catch‑all audience and uniform caps/experience across contexts.
- Limited ability to attribute opens/conversions to specific features or moments.

**Variant:** - Register unique paywall placements for key moments and locations: end/mid onboarding (onboarding complete), each gated feature and feature taps, menu upgrade, app open/app launch/session start, post‑exam/test completion, specific training modules, analytics view, expiration modals, settings, and transaction abandon.
- Fire dedicated events per placement/feature with clear names (e.g., ‘open_paywall_feature_x’) and drive from explicit events like ‘external_share_click’, ‘next_card’, ‘create_plan’.
- Use a placement taxonomy that mirrors user triggers; name by action/location. If there are many entry points, start with a hybrid approach (group related entry points under one placement and pass a parameter), then spin high‑impact ones into their own campaigns.
- Design targeted paywalls for top‑locked features and maintain separate campaign logic per placement.
- Evaluate audiences top‑to‑bottom with per‑event limits; avoid a catch‑all audience that blocks others.
- Trigger paywalls conditionally to A/B test timing and contexts without code changes, and use reporting to see which placements/features drive opens and conversions and to optimize those moments.

## Three‑Tier International Pricing + Localized Tiered Paywalls vs Granular Model

**Description:** Test consolidating international pricing into three country tiers with tier‑specific pricing and localized paywalls against a more granular pricing model. This matters to reduce perceived complexity, simplify operations, maintain consistency, and better align price and UX with local purchasing power and market preferences.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that grouping markets into three tiers (e.g., Tier 1: high LTV, Tier 2: mid, Tier 3: low), mapping each tier to a distinct price anchored in USD with auto‑conversion and consistent relative discounts, assigning pricing by storefront country (and using IP primarily for UX), and localizing paywalls by tier (translated copy, tier‑specific layouts and product emphasis such as yearly/lifetime or text‑heavy where preferred) will yield higher conversions than a more granular pricing model because it reduces complexity, improves clarity, simplifies testing/scaling, and aligns with local purchasing power and market preferences.

**Control:** Current more granular international pricing model and existing paywall(s): pricing segmented at a more detailed level; no three‑tier grouping; existing assignment method for pricing/product eligibility; paywall UX not localized by tier (standard copy/design across markets).

**Variant:** Three‑tier international pricing and localized tiered paywalls: (1) Cluster countries into Tier 1/2/3 (e.g., high/mid/low LTV) and map each tier to a specific price. (2) Anchor prices in USD with auto‑conversion and keep relative discounts consistent across tiers. (3) Use storefront country to determine pricing and product eligibility; use IP‑based country primarily for UX/design personalization. (4) Localize paywalls by tier: translate copy, serve distinct paywalls and price points per tier, and tailor style by market preferences (e.g., emphasize yearly/lifetime where preferred; use more text‑heavy layouts where they perform better).

## Run price/offer tests through first-month churn with a day-30 auto-renew guardrail

**Description:** Evaluate price elasticity and offer quality by running tests long enough to capture first-month churn (through trial end and initial renewal) and by using day-30 auto-renew status as an early retention/LTV proxy. Monitor immediate auto-renew disablement after purchase to get an early read. Apply to both trial and no-trial variants and compare winners beyond initial proceeds/ARPU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that incorporating day-30 auto-renew status and immediate auto-renew disable rates as proxies for retention and LTV, and waiting through trial end and initial renewal, will more accurately identify monetization winners. Variants that lift initial proceeds/ARPU but show materially worse day-30 retention will forecast lower LTV and should not be declared winners.

**Control:** Price and offer tests are judged primarily on initial proceeds/ARPU without a day-30 auto-renew guardrail, and may conclude before first-month cancellations (trial end and initial renewal) can be observed.

**Variant:** For each price and offer (including trial and no-trial) variant: run the test until you can study first-month cancellation rates with enough sample (through trial end and initial renewal); track day-30 auto-renew status after becoming paid as a proxy for longer-term retention/LTV by treatment; monitor the share of new subscribers who immediately disable auto-renew after purchase as an early churn indicator; use the day-30 cancel rate as a guardrail—avoid declaring winners that show materially worse day-30 retention even if initial proceeds are higher; compare variants beyond initial proceeds by projecting cohort LTV using these proxies.

## Holistic paywall test: higher upfront price + trial timeline, optimized for install-to-paying subscriber rate

**Description:** Test pricing and paywall design changes against the end-to-end install-to-paying subscriber rate, judging proceeds across the unified experience (main paywall plus abandonment offers). Use internal analytics (marketing dashboard) as the source of truth for downstream revenue/retention, while leveraging paywall tool metrics (e.g., proceeds per user, projected conversions) as fast directional signals during the test. Explicitly monitor trial-to-paid conversion while optimizing upfront conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that implementing a higher upfront price on the main paywall together with a trial timeline design will increase the install-to-paying subscriber rate and net proceeds across the main + abandonment experience without reducing trial-to-paid conversion, because a higher upfront price can look worse on the main paywall but net out higher once abandonment offers are included, and the trial timeline variant has shown higher paywall conversion with no negative impact on trial-to-paid.

**Control:** Current paywall pricing and design on the main paywall, existing abandonment offer flow, and current trial presentation.

**Variant:** Main paywall with a higher upfront price and a trial timeline design, with abandonment offers included in the overall flow and outcomes evaluated across the unified experience.

## Monthly-to-Annual Price Delta Test (40% vs 60% vs 75%) by Market

**Description:** Systematically vary the effective annual savings versus monthly to identify the threshold that maximizes proceeds per user by market. Where monthly pricing is controllable, use a higher monthly anchor (e.g., $4.99) to strengthen perceived value of annual. Ensure product availability for the test. Some markets are tolerant of stronger anchoring and may respond to larger differentials.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that widening the monthly-to-annual price delta to 40%, 60%, or 75%—by anchoring a higher monthly price where possible—will increase yearly selection and maximize proceeds per user in markets tolerant of stronger anchoring, because a higher monthly strengthens the perceived value of the annual plan.

**Control:** Current pricing: existing monthly and annual price points with the current annual-versus-monthly discount; no changes to the monthly anchor.

**Variant:** Multi-arm price-delta conditions: set annual savings versus monthly to 40%, 60%, and 75%. Where monthly price points are controllable, raise the monthly price (e.g., $4.99) to achieve the target deltas and strengthen anchoring. In markets tolerant of stronger anchoring, target 60%+ and up to 75% relative to annualized pricing. Ensure product availability during the test.

---

## Greedy Combo Variant to Accelerate Learning

**Description:** Combine previously identified likely winners—delayed X, video, and an exit discount—into a single “greedy” variant to see if there’s a step‑change lift, then unwind components if needed.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that combining delayed X + video + exit discount will create a step‑change lift versus the current experience because multiple likely winners are tested together.

**Control:** Current/baseline experience without the combined “delayed X + video + exit discount” configuration.

**Variant:** A single “greedy” variant that simultaneously includes delayed X, video, and an exit discount; assess combined impact and unwind components if needed.

---

## Preload Critical Paywalls and Optimize Assets to Reduce Time-to-Visible

**Description:** Test whether preloading key paywalls on app launch—prioritizing onboarding and other high-impact/high-traffic placements—combined with imagery optimization and CDN delivery reduces paywall load times. Measure time-to-visible using view start/complete events. This addresses observed 5–7 second loads on large assets that can lead to abandonment and aims for instant rendering to improve perceived quality and conversion odds.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that preloading key paywalls on app launch (prioritizing onboarding and other high-impact/high-traffic placements), along with optimizing imagery and using a CDN, will reduce time-to-visible (eliminating observed 5–7 second loads), which will prevent abandonment and improve perceived quality and conversion odds.

**Control:** Paywalls load on demand when the placement is triggered, using the current imagery and delivery approach with no preloading. Time-to-visible is measured via view start/complete events. Teams have observed 5–7 second loads on large assets.

**Variant:** Preload key paywalls at app launch, prioritizing onboarding and other high-impact/high-traffic placements so they render instantly. Apply asset hygiene by optimizing imagery and delivering assets via a CDN. Measure time-to-visible using view start/complete events.

---

## Truthful Relative Savings Badges with Longer-Plan First

**Description:** Replace generic popularity tags with dynamic, locally computed savings messaging that clearly compares longer plans to lower-tier options. Show savings in both percentage and absolute terms (with strike‑through reference pricing), place the longer plan above weekly, highlight only one recommended plan, and add weekly equivalents. This aims to improve clarity, persuasiveness, and plan mix toward annual while avoiding faux discounts (including in the exit modal).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing truthful, locally computed relative savings (vs. monthly/weekly) with clear percent and/or dollar savings, a single highlighted recommendation, longer plan placed first, weekly equivalents, and strike‑through references will outperform generic or vague labels (e.g., “Most popular”)—increasing conversion and nudging selection toward longer plans—because the value is clearer, easier to compare, and more credible.

**Control:** Current paywall uses generic/vague badges (e.g., “Most popular”/“Best deal”), may include multiple labels, does not consistently show explicit or relative savings, may not localize price comparisons, may lack strike‑through reference pricing and weekly equivalents, keeps longer plans below weekly, and can include non‑truthful discount claims in the exit modal.

**Variant:** - Replace generic badges with dynamic savings badges (e.g., “Save X%” and/or “$Y off”) computed from local prices.
- Display savings relative to the next lower‑tier plan (monthly or weekly), ensuring accuracy and avoiding faux discounts, including in the exit modal (e.g., “Save 91% with annual vs weekly”).
- Show both percentage and absolute savings, preferring the larger absolute value if both are available.
- Use strike‑through reference pricing of the lower‑tier plan.
- Present the longer plan first (above weekly) and highlight only one recommended plan.
- Add weekly equivalents to make relative value obvious.

## Season-aligned quarterly/6-month plans matched to 3–4 month paid tenure

**Description:** Test introducing mid-length billing cycles (quarterly and/or 6-month) aligned to observed ~3–4 month paid retention and seasonal usage (e.g., semester-like behavior). Price the quarterly below 3x monthly with a low headline price (e.g., 39.99) to capture medium-term users who won’t commit yearly but are active in-season. Compare against the current monthly/annual (and lifetime if offered) lineup to assess impact on trial-to-paid conversion, proceeds per user, net LTV, and churn vs annual commitments.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a quarterly and/or six-month plan, seasonally surfaced and priced to save vs paying monthly (below monthly x3; e.g., 39.99), will increase trial-to-paid conversion, proceeds per user, and net LTV for seasonal/medium-term users and reduce churn versus annual, because average paid retention is ~3–4 months and behavior follows academic/semester-like patterns; similar cases saw monthly perform worst and yearly renewals remain low.

**Control:** Current paywall lineup with monthly and annual (and/or lifetime) plans shown year-round; no quarterly or 6-month option and no season-specific surfacing or discount relative to 3x monthly.

**Variant:** Add a mid-length option: a quarterly plan aligned to the ~3–4 month paid lifespan and, where appropriate, a 6-month plan. Price the quarterly below 3x the monthly (clear savings) with a low headline price (e.g., 39.99). Surface these mid-length options during relevant seasons (e.g., academic terms) alongside existing plans, and test against the current lineup for differences in trial-to-paid conversion, proceeds per user, net LTV, and churn relative to annual.

## Dynamic Paywall Intro Discount Depth Test (Plateau + Seasonal)

**Description:** Test multiple first-year, time-limited, pay-upfront discount depths on the same paywall using dynamic discount banners to identify the point of diminishing returns and the discount that maximizes proceeds per user/net revenue. Run on plateau users and during seasonal campaigns. Use results to validate/calibrate elasticity-based forecasts. All intro offers automatically renew at full price.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a moderate, clearly time-limited, first-year-only discount delivered via dynamic banners will maximize proceeds per user/net revenue versus deeper discounts or full price because demand is elastic up to a point and additional discounting produces diminishing returns.

**Control:** Full-price paywall with no discount banner (no introductory discount). Renews at full price as standard.

**Variant:** Dynamic discount banners on the same paywall offering first-year, pay-upfront, time-bound introductory pricing at varying depths: 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 33%, and 50% off (all renew at full price thereafter). Run on plateau users and in seasonal campaigns; measure proceeds per user/net revenue and conversion to determine the optimal discount depth and validate elasticity-based forecasts.

## Remove Free Trial on Longest Plan + Add 30–40% Upfront Discount

**Description:** Test removing the free trial from the longest-duration subscription plan (e.g., 6-month) and replacing it with a deeper upfront discount (30–40%). Prior pricing tests, including an 8-month program, showed conversion decreased but ARPU increased substantially (~40% lift), shifting revenue mix toward higher-LTV plans.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that eliminating the trial on the longest-duration plan and offering a deeper upfront discount (30–40%) will increase ARPU and shift revenue mix toward higher-LTV plans, even if conversion declines (as seen previously with ~40% ARPU lift).

**Control:** Current longest-duration plan (e.g., 6-month) includes a free trial; current upfront discounting (if any) remains unchanged.

**Variant:** Remove the free trial from the longest-duration plan and add a deeper upfront discount of approximately 30–40% on that plan.

---

## Paywall reassurance near CTA + simplified plan cards (easy cancel, no payment due now)

**Description:** Test adding clear cancellation guidance and concise reassurance copy near the CTA while simplifying plan cards (emphasize key benefits; show monthly equivalent under annual) versus the current paywall. Prior best practices and tests indicate these elements reduce purchase anxiety, build trust, and have driven lifts in proceeds per user and annual trial conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing clear cancellation guidance and concise reassurance copy near the primary plan/CTA—using “No payment due now” when a trial is available and “No commitment. Cancel anytime.” when no trial is available—along with simplifying plan cards (emphasizing these benefits and showing the monthly equivalent under annual) will increase trust, trial starts, proceeds per user, and annual trial conversion because these messages reduce purchase anxiety and have consistently helped conversion in prior testing.

**Control:** Current paywall without explicit cancellation guidance and without reassurance copy near the CTA/under the primary plan. Existing plan card presentation remains as-is (no streamlined cleanup and no monthly equivalent shown under the annual plan). No trust badges/messages such as “No payment due now,” “No commitment,” or “Cancel anytime.”

**Variant:** Paywall includes: (1) clear cancellation guidance; (2) a concise reassurance line under the primary plan/near the CTA that adapts to availability—if a trial is available, show “No payment due now”; if no trial is available, show “No commitment. Cancel anytime.”; and (3) simplified plan cards that emphasize these key benefits and display the monthly equivalent under the annual plan.

## Value‑First Pre‑Paywall with Core Action Demo, Feature Previews, and Legacy Offer

**Description:** Test a value‑first purchase flow that lets users experience the core action and preview exactly what they’ll unlock before pricing. The flow layers concise education (features, outcomes, trial access) and visual previews (carousel/Lottie, screenshots, modal) ahead of the paywall, uses a primer before any feature gate, and shows legacy/free users a two‑step paywall (“What’s new” then “Your special offer”). Prior insights report improved receptivity when “what you get” appears before payment, better engagement in feature‑locked flows, reduced trial churn with educate‑first paywalls, and higher proceeds per user by clarifying what the trial unlocks (shifting more buyers to annual while keeping conversion stable).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that letting users perform the core action and preview what they’ll unlock—paired with concise education on features, first‑week outcomes, and trial access—will increase readiness to upgrade, improve trial‑to‑paid and overall conversion, reduce trial churn, and increase proceeds per user (via more annual plan selection), because it shows clear value up front, preserves intent at feature gates, and sets concrete expectations. For legacy/free users, a two‑step paywall (“What’s new” → time‑limited legacy offer with strikethrough savings) will increase offer acceptance by highlighting recent value and an exclusive deal.

**Control:** Current gated flow where users hit the paywall before performing the core action; no (or minimal) preview of results/plan/tools; no first‑week outcomes page; no dedicated explanation of trial entitlements; no primer before feature‑gated actions; no feature preview modal; no carousels/Lottie; standard paywall without a “What’s new” step or a legacy‑specific, time‑limited special offer with strikethrough pricing.

**Variant:** A value‑first pre‑paywall experience:
- Core action demo pre‑paywall: Show a live demo of the core feature during onboarding so users experience progress and simplicity/fun before pricing.
- Preview “what you get”: Before asking to pay, show concise visuals of results, plan, and tools users will unlock.
- Educate‑first paywall content: Briefly explain product value, key features, and trial access details (bullets, visuals, or short video) so benefits are understood before starting a trial.
- Trial entitlements page: Add a page detailing exactly what the free trial unlocks (capabilities, limits removed).
- First‑week outcomes messaging: Insert a page outlining what users will accomplish in week one (e.g., setup, first results) between pages in the multi‑page flow.
- Visual reinforcement: Place a concise image carousel or single Lottie near the top of page 1 to depict 3–5 core features/lesson types; insert another carousel with real app screenshots between the first two pages to set expectations; show a feature preview modal (screenshots/video) immediately before purchase.
- Primer before feature gate: When a feature is gated, first show a short primer explaining what it does and why it’s valuable, then present the paywall.
- Legacy/free users: Use a two‑step paywall—(1) “What’s new” with clear visuals of new features; (2) “Your special offer,” an exclusive, time‑limited legacy offer with standard‑price strikethrough and savings.

## Acquisition- and Keyword-Aware Paywalls with Source-Based Pricing

**Description:** Test tailoring the paywall based on acquisition source and ad keyword intent. Pass acquisition source as a user parameter (via MMP/ASA and search ads keyword attribution) and, when missing, collect it with a brief in-app “How did you hear about us?” prompt during onboarding. Use these signals to show source/keyword‑specific paywalls (messaging/pricing/creative) that highlight the most relevant features, benefits, and pricing for the user’s intent. For paid traffic, show pricing that meets CAC/ROAS targets (e.g., higher list price), while keeping organic pricing optimized for growth. Measure performance by acquisition channel, campaign, and keyword, comparing new‑to‑trial, trial‑to‑paid, ARPU, and refund rates. Roll out after paid channels stabilize to avoid confounds and to enable tighter targeting by channel.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that tailoring paywall copy, creative, feature/benefit emphasis, and pricing to a user’s acquisition source and keyword intent will increase new‑to‑trial and trial‑to‑paid conversion and lift ARPU by source—while enabling paid traffic pricing to meet CAC/ROAS targets—because the experience aligns with user intent and channel economics.

**Control:** All users see a single generic paywall regardless of acquisition source, campaign, or keyword, with uniform copy, creative, and pricing (no source routing or keyword‑specific messaging/pricing).

**Variant:** Pass acquisition source and campaign/keyword parameters as user attributes (from MMP/ASA and search ads). If unavailable, prompt “How did you hear about us?” during onboarding to route users. Render acquisition‑aware paywalls that: (1) align copy and creative to the ad keyword intent and landing‑page promise; (2) emphasize the most relevant features/benefits; (3) apply source‑specific pricing/price packs (e.g., higher list price for paid traffic) to meet CAC/ROAS for paid channels and optimize pricing for organic; and (4) test source‑specific copy, price pairs, or incentives. Measure outcomes by channel, campaign, and keyword: new‑to‑trial, trial‑to‑paid, ARPU, and refund rates. Launch after paid channels stabilize.

## Comprehensive Payment Failure Recovery with Guided Retries and Deep‑Linked Prompts

**Description:** Test a unified recovery flow after failed transactions and renewals: timely explanations and guided retries, immediate CRM and in‑app prompts with direct billing‑update links, deep‑linked modals/interstitials during grace/billing‑issue states, and a personalized paywall in the next session. This seeks to recover failed transactions and prevent service interruption.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that providing timely, clear failure explanations and direct paths to retry or update billing (via CRM notifications, in‑app prompts, deep‑linked modals/interstitials, and a next‑session personalized paywall) will increase completion of failed payments and prevent service interruption because users receive immediate guidance and direct links to manage payment details.

**Control:** Existing failure handling only (no timely explanatory messages guiding retries after failed attempts, no immediate CRM or in‑app notifications with direct billing‑update links, no modal or app‑open interstitial in grace/billing‑issue states, and no personalized paywall acknowledging the failed attempt in the next session).

**Variant:** Implement a coordinated recovery sequence:
- When a payment attempt fails (e.g., gateway error, insufficient funds): send a timely message explaining the failure and guiding the user to retry; in the next session, show a personalized paywall that acknowledges the failed attempt and invites completion.
- Upon a failed renewal: notify users immediately via CRM and in‑app prompts with clear instructions or direct links to update billing info to prevent service interruption.
- When subscription status enters a billing issue/grace period: show a modal explaining the issue with a CTA that deep links directly to manage payment details in system settings/platform’s manage subscription screen, and show a billing‑retry interstitial on every app‑open prompting the user to update payment with the same deep link.

## Prominent, Adaptive Trial Timeline on Paywall (Animated, Trust‑Cued)

**Description:** Test adding a clear visual trial timeline to the paywall (and as a multi‑page narrative) to set expectations, emphasize the free period, and build trust. The design uses simple animation (e.g., ticks over seven days) and/or a countdown/progress bar, bold day labels for scannability, concise copy, and trust cues ("No payment today", "Cancel anytime"). Milestones illustrate how the trial works (e.g., Today/Day 1: Free full access; Day 5/6: Reminder; Day 7: Membership starts/charge). The timeline adapts to different trial lengths (e.g., 7‑day vs 30‑day) with generic milestones ("During your trial", "48 hours before end"). Prior tests reported increased conversion (including a 13.6% lift), strong lifts in revenue per user, no negative impact on trial‑to‑paid, lower cancellations, and material lifts in trial‑to‑paid; validate with conversion, trial‑to‑paid, and cancellation metrics.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a prominent, animated, and adaptive trial timeline that clearly explains how the trial works, reinforces "free for X days," and adds trust cues will increase conversion to trial, reduce cancellations, and maintain or improve trial‑to‑paid conversion because it improves scannability, sets expectations, and reduces anxiety.

**Control:** Current paywall without a trial timeline visual—no countdown/progress bar, no animated multi‑page timeline, and no explicit day‑by‑day milestones; existing copy and CTA unchanged.

**Variant:** Add a trial timeline visual on the paywall, placed prominently above the primary CTA. Use bold day labels and concise copy with simple animation (e.g., ticks across seven days) and/or a countdown/progress bar to emphasize remaining free days and that the entire period is free. Show clear milestones, such as: Today/Day 1: full access and free; Day 5/6: reminder; Day 7: membership starts/charge or continue full access. Include trust cues: "No payment today" and "Cancel anytime." Avoid heavy copy and avoid over‑emphasizing the charge day. Implement an adaptive timeline that switches details based on the selected trial length (e.g., 7‑day vs 30‑day) using generic milestones like "During your trial" and "48 hours before end." Present this as a multi‑page narrative where applicable (e.g., Day 1, Days 2–6, Day 7 outcomes).

## Offer-led win-back paywalls for trial cancelers and subscription-inactive users

**Description:** Test whether centering win-back experiences on a concrete offer improves performance across early trial cancelers, broader trial cancelers, and users whose trial/subscription is fully expired. The experiment uses lifecycle/app-open triggers, email/push deep links, and a frequency cap. Offers may be discounts, changed terms, or a new-features paywall, personalized using observed behavior during the brief trial window and with separate content for former higher-tier users. Many trials are canceled within the first hour (track this event), and teams have seen large weekly audiences reachable via app-open campaigns to inactive users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offer-led win-back paywalls—highlighting a tailored discount, changed terms, or new features and personalized by brief trial behavior and prior tier—delivered via lifecycle/app-open triggers with deep links and a frequency cap, will outperform sentimental/generic messaging for trial cancelers (including early cancelers) and subscription-inactive users, because concrete offers are more compelling than sentiment-only messaging.

**Control:** For users who cancel a trial (including within the first hour) and for users whose trial/subscription is fully expired, show a win-back paywall centered on sentimental or generic messaging without a concrete offer. Use the same lifecycle/app-open triggers and email/push deep links to route users to this paywall, with a frequency cap. Content is not personalized by brief trial behavior and does not vary for former higher-tier users.

**Variant:** For the same audiences, replace the win-back experience with an offer-led paywall emphasizing a concrete offer: a tailored discount, changed terms, or a new-features paywall. Personalize the offer using observed behavior during the brief trial window and provide separate content for former higher-tier users. Track cancellations within the first hour and retarget via tailored email/push that deep-links to the offer-led paywall; on next app open, show the discounted/revised/new-features paywall. Use the same lifecycle/app-open triggers and apply the same frequency cap.

## Intent- and entry-point–based trial ladder with abandonment-triggered escalation

**Description:** Test a personalized trial/pricing system that adapts by user intent, entry point, and checkout abandonment. It combines intent-based trial length (7 vs 14 days), entry-point–specific pricing/trial presentation, and an abandonment ladder that starts with a short free trial and escalates to a longer trial only at transaction-abandoned moments (including an Apple purchase sheet dismissal-triggered offer). This aims to improve conversion while limiting cannibalization and preserving perceived value.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that tailoring trial length and pricing to user intent and entry point, and restricting extended trial offers to high‑intent checkout‑abandonment moments (with a short‑then‑longer trial ladder), will increase conversion and reduce cannibalization because low‑intent users convert better with more time, while extended offers shown only at abandonment preserve the value of standard offers.

**Control:** Current standard checkout and paywall experience with a single, uniform price/trial offer across entry points; no intent-based trial length, no checkout‑abandonment–specific short or extended trial offers, and no 7‑day remote offer on Apple purchase sheet dismissal.

**Variant:** Activate a personalized trial/pricing system:
- Intent-based trial length: Use in‑app behavior (e.g., workouts completed in week 1 or self‑declared frequency) to segment users into 7‑day vs 14‑day trials, giving lower‑intent users the longer trial.
- Trial design flexibility: Tailor trial type by audience, choosing between a paid long trial versus a short free trial.
- Entry-point targeting: Present different prices or trial options based on where purchase is initiated—show a trial in lower‑intent areas (e.g., settings) and present a higher price reflecting perceived value on high‑value feature entry points.
- Checkout abandonment ladder (cannibalization‑aware):
  • After several prior paywall views, if a user abandons checkout, offer a short free trial (e.g., 3‑day), capped at once per week.
  • If the short trial is abandoned (e.g., user dismisses Apple’s purchase sheet), trigger a follow‑up longer trial (e.g., 7‑day) via remote call.
  • Reserve 7‑day trial offers for transaction‑abandon events (or seasonally), not for generic paywall closes.
- Measurement: Track whether the 7‑day remote abandonment offer increases conversion versus the standard checkout path.

## Selective Lifetime Plan: Exit-Intent, Anchoring, and Downsell Pricing (~2–2.5×)

**Description:** Test using a lifetime plan as a selective lever to capture upfront revenue while minimizing cannibalization of recurring subscriptions. The experiment combines: (a) using lifetime primarily on exit and for reactivation/seasonal promos; (b) positioning a high‑priced lifetime SKU as an anchor on the main paywall only in markets that prefer long‑term value; and (c) adding a post‑dismiss, heavily discounted lifetime downsell. Pricing targets center around ~2–2.5× expected annual LTV or ~2.5× the annual/best‑performing subscription LTV. This matters to capture high‑LTV buyers who don’t want subscriptions, anchor other plans, and protect long‑term recurring revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that pricing a lifetime plan around ~2–2.5× expected annual LTV (or ~2.5× the annual/best‑performing subscription LTV) and showing it primarily on exit or as a post‑dismiss downsell (even below annual), while only featuring it on the main paywall in markets that prefer long‑term value, will capture more upfront revenue from users who won’t renew or don’t want subscriptions, effectively anchor weekly/annual plans, and avoid cannibalizing long‑term recurring revenue.

**Control:** Standard paywall without a lifetime option (e.g., weekly/annual only). No exit‑intent lifetime offer, no post‑dismiss lifetime downsell, and no reactivation/seasonal lifetime promos.

**Variant:** - Pricing: Introduce a lifetime SKU priced around ~2–2.5× expected annual LTV or ~2.5× the annual / the LTV of the best‑performing subscription; test price increases.
- Placement strategy:
  • Primary paywall (market‑specific): In markets that prefer long‑term value (e.g., parts of Europe), add the high‑priced lifetime plan primarily as an anchor to make weekly more attractive and to anchor annual; monitor cannibalization risk.
  • Elsewhere: Do not show lifetime on the initial paywall.
- Exit and downsell:
  • Exit‑intent: Offer lifetime as an alternative path to capture upfront high‑LTV buyers who don’t want subscriptions.
  • Post‑dismiss: After the first paywall is closed, present a second, heavily discounted lifetime offer (even below annual) to salvage revenue.
- Lifecycle usage: Use lifetime primarily as an exit path and for reactivation/seasonal promotions while steering most users to annual; treat lifetime as a revenue capture fallback for those unlikely to renew.

## Reduce Paywall Cognitive Load: One Primary Decision + Simple Discount Framing

**Description:** Test a simplified, short, single‑purpose paywall that minimizes reading, math, and choices. Present one primary decision at a time, move dense side‑by‑side comparisons below the fold, use visuals, show clear per‑period equivalents, and use a big, simple %‑off badge. This matters because US audiences especially respond to short, single‑purpose screens; overloaded top sections push users to exit or default to the cheapest option; and users gloss over dense or redundant text.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that reducing cognitive load on the paywall—by limiting decisions, minimizing reading, avoiding mental math, presenting one primary decision at a time, moving detailed comparisons below the fold, using visuals, showing per‑period equivalents, and using a big, clear %‑off badge—will improve comprehension and conversion (especially for US audiences), because dense, math‑heavy, and option‑heavy designs cause confusion, exits, and defaults to the cheapest option.

**Control:** Current paywall with dense side‑by‑side pricing comparisons above the fold; multiple simultaneous decisions (e.g., tier toggle and plan) on the same screen; longer copy blocks with redundant messages (e.g., repeating cancel‑anytime or trial mentions); discounts framed as extra months or strike‑through prices that require mental math; savings not clearly shown as per‑period equivalents; and multiple CTAs on a single screen.

**Variant:** - Short, single‑purpose paywall optimized for clarity (notably effective for US audiences).
- Present one primary decision at a time (tier toggle or plan); move detailed, side‑by‑side comparisons below the fold.
- Reduce options and limit CTAs per screen; keep value props brief and present comparisons plainly and clearly.
- Trim redundant copy (e.g., remove repeated cancel‑anytime or multiple trial mentions); avoid large copy blocks users gloss over.
- Use visuals to aid comprehension.
- Eliminate mental math: show clear per‑period equivalents and state savings as a straightforward percentage or price‑off (not extra months).
- Display a big, simple %‑off badge computed dynamically from the anchor price (often weekly); use this clean badge instead of a strike‑through price and avoid competing discounts on‑screen.
- Trial‑focused, concise copy such as “No payment today” and a clear CTA like “Start my 7‑day free trial.”

## Paywall Trial Toggle (Opt-In) vs Auto-Included Trial

**Description:** Test adding an explicit “Enable free trial” toggle/checkbox on the paywall that lets users choose to start a free trial or pay immediately. This makes the trial unmistakably clear, gives users agency to opt in, and may drive higher ARPU/MRR by capturing immediate purchasers while improving trial-to-paid conversion. Measure overall trial sign-ups, initial conversion, immediate purchase rate, trial-to-paid, ARPU, MRR, retention, churn, and refunds/cancellations. Implementation notes captured from the insights: baseline configuration offers a 7-day free trial at the same price point as paying now; the toggle sits above the plan selector; requires separate products with and without intro offers; handle copy, eligibility, and CTA states; hide/disable trial UI for plans without trials. Additional variables surfaced by the insights (for follow-on or sub-tests): default state of the toggle (OFF vs ON), vertical placement (top vs bottom), and price differentiation (slightly higher price with a trial vs lower price for immediate purchase to reduce post-trial churn).

**Hypothesis:** We believe requiring users to explicitly enable a 7-day free trial via a paywall toggle (vs auto-including or auto-enrolling them) will increase trial awareness and user agency, lifting immediate purchases and trial-to-paid conversion, resulting in higher ARPU/MRR and lower post-trial churn and refunds/cancellations. If price differentiation is applied (slightly higher with a trial, lower for immediate purchase), we believe it will further reduce post-trial churn by encouraging self-selection into the most suitable path.

**Control:** Current single-path paywall with no explicit trial toggle: the trial is auto-included or eligible users are auto-enrolled at load; users cannot choose between paying now and starting a trial; standard (non-differentiated) pricing and existing UI placement remain unchanged.

**Variant:** Add a trial on/off toggle (or “Enable trial” checkbox) on the paywall above the plan selector. Default the toggle to OFF so users must manually opt in to start the trial. When enabled, the user starts a 7-day free trial; when left OFF, the user pays immediately—both at the same price point. If the user selects a plan without a trial, hide/disable the trial UI to keep messaging and pricing accurate. Implement with separate products for with/without intro offers and handle copy, eligibility rules, and CTA states accordingly. Track: overall trial sign-up rate, initial conversion, immediate purchase rate, trial-to-paid conversion, ARPU, MRR, retention, churn, and refunds/cancellations. Optional sub-conditions sourced from the insights (if included): toggle default ON vs OFF, top vs bottom placement, and a price-differentiated configuration (slightly higher with trial, lower for immediate purchase) to test churn impact.

## Segmented Discounts: Exclude High-WTP From Core Plan Discounts and Use Alternative Promos

**Description:** Test replacing blanket core plan discounting with a structured, targeted approach: exclude high‑willingness‑to‑pay segments (high‑spending markets/geos, latest‑device users including latest iOS, ages 27–40) from standard plan discounts, and offer them alternative promotions (e.g., buy‑one‑get‑one or discounted multi‑year plans). This aims to minimize revenue cannibalization, protect LTV, and avoid poor renewal outcomes associated with blanket discounting.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that excluding high‑spending markets, latest‑device users, and users aged 27–40 from core plan discounts—and instead offering these cohorts alternative promotions such as buy‑one‑get‑one or discounted multi‑year plans—will reduce cannibalization and increase net revenue and LTV (with better renewal rates) versus blanket discounting.

**Control:** Blanket discounting of the core/standard plan across segments, including high‑spending markets, latest‑device users, and ages 27–40 (standard price discount shown broadly).

**Variant:** A structured, targeted discount program: • Exclude high‑WTP segments (high‑spending geos, latest‑device users, ages 27–40) from core/standard plan discounts. • For these excluded segments, do not discount the standard plan; instead present alternative promotions such as buy‑one‑get‑one or discounted multi‑year plans. • Continue offering standard plan discounts only to non‑high‑WTP segments.

## Unified urgency timers + explicit savings framing on paywall and exit/rescue offers

**Description:** Test the combined impact of defensible countdown timers and limited-time language across the main paywall, discount paywalls, and exit/rescue offers, paired with explicit savings framing (original vs. discounted price, strikethrough, percent saved) and reduced friction on exit offers. Prior tests noted a 15-minute main paywall timer increased ARPU; strike-through vs. percent-off badge performed similarly, with simpler designs often winning. This experiment also observes user sentiment and ensures timer logic avoids deceptive experiences.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding visible, defensible countdown timers with one-time-only/limited-time language, plus explicit value framing (strikethrough original price, percent saved, original vs. discounted price) and preselecting the exit-offer plan so the CTA purchases it directly, will increase conversions and ARPU because urgency reinforces action and clearer savings reduce ambiguity about value.

**Control:** Current paywall and exit/rescue experiences without countdown timers or limited-time/one-time-only language; prices shown without explicit original-vs-discounted comparison (no strikethrough/percent-saved); exit/rescue CTA does not purchase a preselected plan; no countdown that persists after closing; existing CTA copy remains unchanged.

**Variant:** Implement an urgency-and-value package across surfaces:
- Main paywall (special/legacy discounts): Add a 15-minute countdown; use limited-time/one-time-only language (e.g., won’t be available later); keep design clean; ensure timer logic is defensible (hide/reset appropriately; for true sales, use a real end date that can later show “Sale extended”).
- Discount paywalls: Add a short countdown (~60 minutes); keep it visually subtle and consistent with guidelines.
- Exit/rescue offers: Add a visible timer; optionally use a short, session-only countdown (~30s) shown once per user on special offers; use one-time-only/limited-time phrasing; persist a countdown indicator in-app after the paywall is closed to remind users before expiry; preselect the alternative plan (e.g., monthly) so the primary CTA purchases it directly; include a plain “No thanks.” option.
- Savings framing: Show the standard/higher price struck through next to the special price (use a red strikethrough where policy allows); display original vs. discounted price and the percent saved; use a strong CTA like “Claim now.” On exit modals, anchor value by striking through the standard price and/or highlighting a shorter-term alternative.
- Guardrails and notes: Limit any session-only timer to one show per user to avoid erosion of trust; ensure timers are not deceptive; track urgency effects and user sentiment. Note: A strike-through price vs. bold percent-off badge has performed similarly in prior tests; simpler designs often win on clarity.

## Monthly-to-Yearly Upsell Intercept at Point of Purchase

**Description:** Test whether interposing a modal/interstitial when users select the lower-priced monthly plan increases switches to higher-LTV yearly plans. The intercept highlights a clear savings percentage (e.g., 25%) and mentions trial availability, leverages declared purchase intent with a simple yes/no choice, and allows users to continue with monthly if they decline. A/B the presence of this intercept to measure upsell lift.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prompting users who select monthly with a modal that highlights clear annual savings (e.g., 25%) and trial availability will shift a portion of them to yearly plans—without blocking purchase intent—because it leverages declared purchase intent at the point of purchase with a simple yes/no choice.

**Control:** No intercept shown. When a user selects monthly, they proceed directly with the monthly plan as usual.

**Variant:** When a user selects monthly, show a small modal/interstitial prompting “Switch to annual and save [clear percentage, e.g., 25%],” highlighting annual savings and trial availability. Provide two buttons: switch to annual or continue with monthly. If declined, allow users to continue with monthly.

---

## Transaction/Checkout Abandonment Recovery Offers: Discount vs Longer Trial vs Discount+Trial

**Description:** When a transaction/checkout is abandoned, present an alternative recovery offer and compare three options: a direct discount with no trial, a longer trial at the normal price (e.g., 7-day or 14-day), and a discounted plan with the standard trial. Keep features minimal and focus on offer clarity. For discount offers, use clear, time-based (“limited-time”) language. This matters to identify which approach yields the highest recovery and better net revenue and retention, while validating concerns that stacking discount + trial can erode revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting clear, time-bound recovery offers after abandonment will increase recoveries, and that either a longer trial at the normal price or a discounted no-trial offer will outperform a discount-plus-trial on net revenue and retention because stacking a discount with a trial can erode revenue.

**Control:** Current abandonment experience with no special alternative offer (no added discount or extended trial beyond the status quo).

**Variant:** Multi-arm test after abandonment:
- Variant A — Discount-only: Offer a cheaper price with no free trial. Use clear, time-based “limited-time” language. Keep features minimal and focus on offer clarity.
- Variant B — Longer trial at normal price: Offer an extended trial at the same/normal price (e.g., 7-day or 14-day). No discount. Keep features minimal and focus on offer clarity.
- Variant C — Discount + standard trial: Offer a discounted plan with the standard trial (do not extend the trial). Use clear, time-based “limited-time” language to frame the discount.

## Dynamic Personalized Paywall vs Evergreen Trial‑First Paywall

**Description:** Test a single, dynamically personalized paywall against a generic, trial‑first paywall. The variant personalizes copy, visuals (including imagery/video), plan emphasis, and social proof using onboarding inputs, known user attributes, entry‑point context, geo/locale, and seasonal/pain‑point cues. This aims to increase relevance at the moment of intent, highlight exactly what will be unlocked, reflect local/cultural context, and reduce cognitive load. Focus personalization on attributes believed to influence purchase intent.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a single paywall dynamically personalized by season/interest, onboarding attributes (sport/interest, team, experience level), user attributes/persona (e.g., life stage or role), entry‑point context (feature tapped), and geo/locale (local leagues, currencies, cultural markers)—including journey‑specific imagery/video, persona‑relevant testimonials, and a preview of what will be unlocked—will increase conversion and revenue versus an evergreen trial‑first paywall because it is more timely, relevant, and reduces cognitive load. Persona‑relevant social proof will also reduce immediate trial cancels.

**Control:** Current evergreen paywall that leads with a free trial, uses generic bullets and generic hero image/video, standard screenshots/testimonials, and identical content for all users regardless of season, interests, persona, geo/locale, onboarding inputs, or entry point. No contextual parameters or previews of unlocked content.

**Variant:** A single paywall using dynamic variables (one design, configured per user/context):
- Seasonal/interest positioning: Swap screenshots/testimonials and messaging to match current season (e.g., league in season), holidays, or current pain points (slump, fatigue, season prep). Use timely copy (e.g., “Get a head start on your New Year goals,” “Prioritize your health during the holidays”) when relevant.
- Onboarding attributes: Personalize copy, feature visuals, examples, and plan emphasis from captured inputs (sport/interest, team, experience level).
- User attributes/persona: Tailor images and copy to life stage/role; show persona‑relevant testimonials (e.g., student vs professional) on the final decision step.
- Entry‑point/source context: If the paywall is triggered from a specific feature, highlight that exact feature/benefit first, adjust visuals/gradient, and hide duplicates in the carousel. Pass contextual parameters (text or images), including a preview of what will be unlocked.
- Geo/locale: Localize copy/creative to device locale/country (e.g., local leagues, currencies, cultural markers), especially for users outside the primary market.
- Imagery/video: Use lifestyle or product visuals personalized to declared intent, and swap the hero video based on the user’s selected journey (vs a generic video).

## Annual Plan Value Framing: % Savings vs Equivalent Pricing (Monthly/Weekly) vs Trial-forward

**Description:** Test which value framing on plan cards best increases yearly plan selection and overall conversion: percentage discount, equivalent per-period pricing (monthly or weekly), or trial-forward messaging. Designs draw from prior paywall hacks: show the yearly total alongside its per-month equivalent, a strikethrough of the full monthly-total, an explicit “Save X%” (or “Save $Y”) label, and the weekly equivalent (e.g., “≈ $0.48/week”). Plan cards are vertically aligned so comparisons are visually obvious, and the full billed price remains clearly visible. Previous use of discount percentage plus equivalent pricing (including an equivalent NZM reading of the price) reportedly raised conversions by 50% and proceeds per user by 62.5%.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that framing the annual plan as a clear percent savings and/or as an equivalent per-period price (monthly or weekly), presented on vertically aligned plan cards with the full billed price visible, will increase yearly plan selection, overall conversions, and proceeds per user because it clarifies the discount versus shorter plans, strengthens the value anchor, and makes the annual price feel more affordable.

**Control:** Current/baseline plan presentation as-is, without explicit percent savings, equivalent monthly or weekly pricing, strikethrough of the full monthly-total, or “Save X%”/“Save $Y” labels; existing layout preserved.

**Variant:** Multi-arm value framing on plan cards (full billed price always clearly visible; cards vertically aligned for easy comparison):
- Variant A: Percent savings vs shorter plans — show explicit “Save X%” (or “Save $Y”) on the annual plan relative to monthly/weekly; include strikethrough of the full monthly-total.
- Variant B: Equivalent monthly price — show the total yearly price plus its per‑month equivalent; include strikethrough of the full monthly-total.
- Variant C: Equivalent weekly price — show the annual plan’s weekly equivalent (e.g., “≈ $0.48/week”) alongside the total yearly price.
- Variant D: Combined discount percentage + equivalent pricing — show yearly total, per‑month equivalent, strikethrough of the full monthly-total, and explicit “Save X%” (or “Save $Y”); include an equivalent NZM reading of the price.
- Variant E: Trial-forward messaging for the annual plan, with the full billed price clearly visible.

## Proactive payment method expiry reminders

**Description:** Monitor upcoming card expirations and send timely reminders with a simple, direct path to update payment details before renewal to reduce involuntary churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that proactively notifying customers of upcoming card expirations and providing a simple, direct path to update payment details before renewal will reduce involuntary churn.

**Control:** Maintain the current experience without introducing proactive card-expiry reminders or a new direct path to update payment details before renewal.

**Variant:** Monitor upcoming card expirations and send timely reminders that include a simple, direct path for customers to update their payment details before renewal.

## Simplify Paywall: Core Elements, Fewer Choices, CTA Emphasis

**Description:** Test whether a simplified, low‑distraction paywall that focuses on the four core elements (headline, price, discount if any, CTA), reduces cognitive load (fewer choices, less reading, no math), and minimizes visual noise (simplified colors, limited animations, concise copy) improves conversion. Prior tests indicate cleaner layouts with a single focal animation and concise copy, plus fewer decisions and no comparisons, convert better.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing only the headline, price, discount (if any), and CTA; promoting a recommended plan to minimize decisions; using concise copy with no comparisons or mental math; and minimizing colors/animations to emphasize the CTA will increase paywall conversion because users focus on these core elements and cleaner, less text‑heavy designs reduce cognitive load and distractions.

**Control:** Current paywall includes additional elements beyond price, discount, headline, and CTA; presents multiple plan choices or comparisons that can require mental math; uses heavier, denser copy; employs more colorful designs and/or multiple animations; and places less emphasis on the CTA.

**Variant:** Paywall displays only the four core elements: headline, price, discount (if any), and a prominent CTA; promotes a single recommended plan to reduce decisions; uses concise copy with no plan comparisons or mental math; simplifies color usage; limits to a single focal animation; and removes other nonessential elements.

## Prioritized low-friction payment update channels after failure

**Description:** Test whether offering multiple low-friction payment update methods—native wallet payments and streamlined web checkout—in addition to card entry, and prioritizing the easiest option for the user’s device and context, recovers more failed payments than sending users through a single high-friction path. This evaluates which payment update path (native wallet vs. web checkout vs. card entry) yields the highest recovery for your audience.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering multiple low-friction payment update options and prioritizing the easiest based on device and context after a payment failure will increase recovery compared to a single high-friction path (card entry) because lower friction makes payment updates more effortless.

**Control:** After a payment failure, route users to a single, high-friction payment update path: standard card entry via web checkout (no native wallet or streamlined option).

**Variant:** After a payment failure, surface multiple low-friction payment update options—native wallet payments and streamlined web checkout—in addition to card entry, and prioritize the easiest option for the user’s device and context.

## Primary ad monetization in ultra-low LTV markets

**Description:** In markets where subscription LTV is negligible, test making ads the primary monetization approach when ad CPMs materially exceed in-app purchase (IAP) LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that in markets with negligible subscription LTV, making ads the primary monetization will outperform subscriptions/IAPs when CPMs materially exceed IAP LTV.

**Control:** Current monetization approach where subscriptions and/or in-app purchases are the primary revenue sources in these markets.

**Variant:** Ads are the primary monetization in these markets, run only where CPMs materially exceed IAP LTV (subscriptions/IAPs de-emphasized).

---

## Placement-specific pricing, offers, and packaging

**Description:** Test tailoring pricing and packaging by placement and surface: use more aggressive offers in historically low-converting placements and keep the standard price in high-converting placements; vary plan visibility, intervals, and copy for onboarding vs. re‑engagement surfaces based on observed trial start and trial‑to‑paid rates by placement. Monitor proceeds per user and cannibalization.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adjusting pricing and packaging by placement—showing a more aggressive offer (e.g., discount) in historically low‑converting placements, keeping the standard price in high‑converting placements, and tailoring plan visibility, intervals, and copy for onboarding vs. re‑engagement based on observed trial start and trial‑to‑paid rates—will increase proceeds per user without cannibalization.

**Control:** Standard price and existing plan visibility, intervals, and copy shown without placement‑specific adjustments.

**Variant:** Apply placement‑specific adjustments: for historically low‑converting placements, show a more aggressive offer (e.g., discount); for high‑converting placements, keep the standard price. For onboarding vs. re‑engagement surfaces, use different plan visibility, intervals, and copy informed by observed trial start and trial‑to‑paid rates by placement. Monitor proceeds per user and cannibalization.

## Reverse-exit upsell modal at high intent (more units/lines)

**Description:** When a user signals high intent (chooses a plan or proceeds to purchase), present a terminating “reverse exit” yes/no modal offering a higher-capacity package (e.g., more units/lines) with clear per‑unit savings. This tests whether a low-friction upsell at the point of commitment increases ARPU and the trade-off in drop-off from added friction.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a terminating “reverse exit” yes/no modal at high intent, offering a higher-capacity package with clear per-unit savings, will increase ARPU versus no modal, with any added friction observable as drop-off.

**Control:** Current purchase flow with no reverse-exit modal; users proceed with their originally selected plan without an upsell interruption.

**Variant:** Upon high-intent action (choosing a plan or proceeding to purchase), display a terminating yes/no modal that offers a higher-value/higher-capacity package (more units/lines) and highlights clear per-unit savings. If the user selects Yes, switch to the higher-capacity package and continue checkout; if No, dismiss the modal and continue with the originally selected plan. Measure incremental ARPU and any drop-off from the added step.

---

## Optimize UA event to prevent model learning starvation

**Description:** Test switching paid acquisition optimization from sparse trial starts to a higher-volume, value-correlated in-app action so growth engines keep learning while monetization experiments proceed independently.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that when trial starts are too sparse to serve as a reliable optimization signal, optimizing paid acquisition to a higher-volume, value-correlated in-app action will keep growth engines learning while monetization experiments proceed independently.

**Control:** Paid acquisition campaigns optimize to trial starts as the primary event, even when trial starts are sparse.

**Variant:** Paid acquisition campaigns optimize to a higher-volume, value-correlated in-app action instead of trial starts.

---

## Localized Pricing and Messaging via Big Mac Index + WTP (by Region and OS)

**Description:** Test combining a practical purchasing-power proxy (Big Mac Index) with willingness-to-pay research segmented by geography and operating system, alongside regionalized copy and value framing. This evaluates whether using the Big Mac Index as a pricing sanity check, refining with WTP inputs, and tailoring messaging by region helps set prices that match local purchasing power and platform expectations while improving relevance of value framing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that aligning regional price tiers using the Big Mac Index as a purchasing-power sanity check, validated and refined by willingness-to-pay research segmented by geography and OS, and pairing this with localized copy and framing by region will set prices that match local purchasing power and platform expectations and make messaging more resonant.

**Control:** Existing pricing and paywall copy without regional or OS-specific price parity checks, without willingness-to-pay segmentation, and without region-specific wording or value framing.

**Variant:** - Use the Big Mac Index to approximate purchasing power by market and align regional price tiers (e.g., if a Big Mac is ~30% cheaper, consider ~30% lower local pricing) as a practical starting point for price parity decisions.
- Run a willingness-to-pay study segmented by geography and operating system; use surveys, A/B tests, and market research to inform and refine local price levels so they match local purchasing power and platform expectations.
- Localize copy, price levels, and value framing by region: for some regions, emphasize discounts and monthly anchoring; in others, highlight social proof and trust signals.

## Extend follow-up discounts to monetized feature exits and stagger by intent

**Description:** Test extending follow-up discounts beyond onboarding to moments when users back out of monetized features (e.g., after viewing a feature paywall), and stagger incentives by intent level. This aims to capture intent where it’s strongest and has performed well.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that extending follow-up discounts to monetized feature exits and staggering incentives by intent (moderate on paywall decline; deeper for transaction abandoners), with copy and offers tailored to the specific product/plan dismissed or abandoned, will increase conversions because it captures intent where it’s strongest.

**Control:** Follow-up discounts are limited to onboarding only.

**Variant:** Trigger follow-up discounts when users back out of monetized features (e.g., after viewing a feature paywall). Use a moderate incentive on paywall decline (broader audience) and a deeper incentive for transaction abandoners (higher intent). Tailor copy and offers to the specific product/plan they dismissed or abandoned.

---

## Pair Introductory Discount with Free Trial (Where Allowed)

**Description:** Test combining an introductory discount with a free trial to increase conversions for both new and existing users in contexts where platform rules permit. Insights indicate this combination produces measurable lift despite platform limits.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that combining an introductory discount with a free trial, where platform rules permit, will increase conversions for both new and existing users because this combination has produced measurable lift even with platform limits.

**Control:** Current offers without combining a discount and a free trial (i.e., no discount+free trial combo).

**Variant:** Offer an introductory discount paired with an introductory free trial where platform rules allow, targeting both new and existing users.

---

## Blurred, navigable preview under paywall vs standard hard‑stop/placeholder gating

**Description:** Test showing a blurred preview of personalized results/plan content or the destination screen beneath a minimal, in‑app purchase UI with visible unlock CTAs—allowing users to continue navigating while details remain blurred—against current standard gating that uses blank placeholders or a blocking message and prevents progression. This aims to sustain intent, align the paywall with the job‑to‑be‑done, reduce context switching, and drive more opens and upgrades without hurting sentiment or UX.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting blurred premium content (with an “unblur” upgrade CTA) beneath a minimal purchase UI and allowing soft‑continue navigation will increase upgrades and opens, sustain intent, and maintain or improve sentiment/UX versus blank placeholders or a standard hard‑stop gating message, because the blurred preview creates stronger perceived loss and urgency, aligns with the job‑to‑be‑done, and reduces context switching.

**Control:** Standard gating before the paywall using blank placeholders or a gating message; content is fully gated (can’t proceed), with no preview of the destination screen, no blurred content, no visible unlock CTAs, and navigation is blocked (hard stop).

**Variant:** Blur premium data and personalized results/plan content (i.e., the destination screen) beneath a minimal, in‑app purchase UI with visible unlock CTAs; require upgrade to “unblur”; allow users to continue navigating while details remain blurred (soft continue), aligning the paywall with the job‑to‑be‑done and reducing context switching.

## Unified Paywall Dismissal with In‑App Free‑Trial Popup and Guardrailed Decline vs Abandonment Winbacks

**Description:** Test showing a free‑trial popup via native Apple/Google purchase sheet and unifying dismissal routing into distinct paywall‑decline vs transaction‑abandonment campaigns. Tailor offers and follow‑ups per segment and add guardrails to increase relevance and conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that displaying a free‑trial popup via Apple/Google in‑app purchase sheet and unifying dismissal logic to route decliners vs transaction‑abandoners into distinct, guardrailed campaigns—offering a cheaper offer to decliners and a deeper discount to abortive purchasers, plus testing immediate follow‑ups (e.g., lifetime vs annual‑with‑trial) and subsequent session re‑entry via a gentle interstitial—will increase conversion and relevance because targeting by the specific failed event gives higher relevance.

**Control:** Existing paywall flow without unified dismissal routing, without distinct decline vs transaction‑abandoned campaigns, and without targeted offers triggered by dismissing the native purchase sheet (no guardrails on frequency or market).

**Variant:** 1) Integrate a free‑trial popup via the native Apple or Google purchase bottom sheet. 2) Unify dismissal logic: if the native sheet is dismissed, route to a specialized “transaction abandoned” campaign; if the paywall is declined before starting purchase, route to a separate decline campaign. 3) Offers: provide a cheaper offer for decliners and a deeper discount for abortive purchasers. 4) For transaction‑abandoned users, test offer variations on the immediate follow‑up after canceling the Apple/Google sheet (e.g., lifetime vs annual‑with‑trial) and a gentle interstitial on subsequent session re‑entry. 5) Trigger targeted offers after users dismiss the native purchase sheet. 6) Apply guardrails: seen ≥4 paywalls, max once per week, and limit to higher purchase power markets first.

---

## Annual + Lifetime vs Annual Only (with Lifetime Discount Levels)

**Description:** Compare offering both annual and lifetime plans against offering only an annual plan to assess impact on revenue and conversion. The goal is to capture upfront revenue from users who prefer a one-time payment, broaden appeal, and capture varied willingness to pay. Measure incremental revenue and churn behavior, and include tests of different discount levels for the lifetime offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting both annual and lifetime purchase options, and testing different lifetime discount levels, will increase conversion and total revenue versus offering annual only because it broadens appeal, captures varied willingness to pay, captures upfront revenue from users who prefer a one-time payment, and removes ongoing recurring cost planning for those users.

**Control:** Only the annual plan is offered.

**Variant:** Offer both annual and lifetime plans. Present the lifetime option alongside the annual option and test different discount levels for the lifetime offer while measuring incremental revenue and churn behavior.

---

## Consolidate Pre‑Paywall Screens Into the Paywall

**Description:** Test streamlining the path to purchase by removing redundant primers and interstitials when using contextual gating (e.g., blurred preview paywall on a gated feature), skipping explanatory screens to go directly to pricing (with smarter defaults), and folding the onboarding summary into the first page(s) of a multi‑page paywall built in the paywall tool. This matters because double‑gating and extra steps create friction that can depress initial conversions, and building these elements in the paywall tool enables measurement, quick iteration of copy/layout, and improved click‑through to the paywall without app updates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that consolidating pre‑paywall steps—removing the primer/interstitial/explanatory screens when a contextual (blurred preview) paywall is shown, going straight to pricing with smarter defaults, and integrating the onboarding summary into the first page(s) of a multi‑page paywall—will increase click‑through to the paywall and initial conversions because extra steps cause double‑gating and friction and have not improved downstream outcomes, while building inside the paywall tool enables faster iteration.

**Control:** Current flow retains all pre‑paywall steps: a primer modal before a gated feature, an interstitial (e.g., “Only premium can access”) before the paywall, a hard‑coded pre‑paywall summary page, and explanatory screens before reaching the paywall; pricing defaults remain as is.

**Variant:** Streamlined flow: when using a contextual blurred preview paywall, remove the prior primer modal; remove the pre‑paywall interstitial (or, if needed, rebuild it within the paywall tool to measure and improve click‑through); skip explanatory screens and route directly to the pricing screen with smarter defaults; fold the onboarding summary into the first page(s) of a multi‑page paywall built in the paywall tool to enable rapid copy/layout iteration without app updates.

---

## Annual-only vs Annual+Monthly Paywall Visibility

**Description:** Compare an annual-only primary paywall to a two-plan layout (annual + monthly) to balance simplicity and transparency. Evaluate impact on overall conversion, ARPU/proceeds per user, annual share (target ≥90%), plan mix, and churn. Prior tests noted that surfacing the monthly plan significantly increased monthly selection.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing both annual and monthly plans side-by-side with the annual plan preselected and a savings badge will increase overall conversion while keeping proceeds per user stable and maintaining ≥90% annual selections, because transparent plan comparison anchors annual savings and reduces drop-off, while offering a monthly option can reduce churn.

**Control:** Annual-only paywall on the primary/final step: only the yearly plan is visible (with a trial), shorter plans are removed from the primary screen. Monthly (and any other plans) are accessible only via a “View all/other plans” link that opens a bottom sheet.

**Variant:** Two-plan paywall on the primary/final step: show both annual and monthly plans side-by-side, with the annual plan preselected by default and highlighted with a savings badge.

---

## Trigger‑Level Paywall Optimization: All‑Placements Learning, Then Split High‑Intent Outliers

**Description:** Test whether tracking proceeds and conversion by placement/trigger, then prioritizing high‑intent triggers (e.g., tapping into a locked feature) with customized contextual paywalls and copy—while deprioritizing low‑converting placements—improves outcomes versus treating all placements the same. Start by routing multiple placements into one campaign to collect comparable data (views, conversions), then split over‑ or under‑performing placements into dedicated campaigns and optimize each separately.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that identifying high‑intent, high‑value paywall triggers via per‑placement metrics (views, proceeds, paywall‑to‑trial, and trial‑to‑paid) and giving those triggers dedicated campaigns with tailored contextual paywalls and copy will increase conversion and proceeds compared to handling all placements together, because targeted designs and messages better match user intent at each entry point while low‑converting placements are deprioritized.

**Control:** Multiple placements routed into a single undifferentiated paywall/campaign with generic design and copy; performance tracked in aggregate without per‑placement or trigger‑level breakdowns.

**Variant:** Phase 1 (learning): Route multiple placements into one “all placements” campaign to collect comparable data. For each placement/trigger, measure views, conversions, proceeds, paywall‑to‑trial, and trial‑to‑paid; group by trigger type (e.g., onboarding, contextual, campaign). Phase 2 (split and optimize): After a few weeks, identify outliers. Split high‑impact placements (e.g., taps into locked features) into dedicated campaigns; create customized contextual paywalls and copy for each and optimize separately. Deprioritize low‑converting placements.

## Product-specific exit winbacks using ID filters

**Description:** Test showing immediate, targeted follow-up offers when the native purchase sheet is opened but not completed, tailored to the exact product abandoned (e.g., specific yearly price tiers or monthly/weekly) using paywall_id and abandoned_product_id. Avoid ambiguous OR logic that can leak audiences. Prior results noted that tailoring by the abandoned offer outperformed single generic discount flows and helps rescue high-intent users, especially where annual-with-trial abandonment is highest.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that immediate, exit-intent winback offers tailored to the exact product a user abandoned—identified via paywall_id and/or abandoned_product_id—will outperform a single generic discount flow in recapturing abandoners because the offers are contextual to what was abandoned (e.g., extended trial or lower first-month for annual abandoners; price step-downs like $49.99→$29.99 or $29.99→$19.99; monthly→$19.99/yr) and precise filtering prevents audience leakage.

**Control:** Single generic discount/exit offer shown on purchase abandonment, not tailored to the abandoned product or price point, and not filtered by paywall_id or abandoned_product_id.

**Variant:** When the native purchase sheet is opened but not completed, immediately trigger an exit-intent winback that is tailored by the abandoned_product_id (and scoped by paywall_id), avoiding ambiguous OR logic. If the user abandons: (a) annual (including annual-with-trial), show an annual-specific offer such as an extended trial or a lower first-month offer; (b) specific yearly price tiers (e.g., $69.99/yr, $49.99/yr, $29.99/yr), present tier-appropriate step-downs (e.g., $49.99→$29.99, $29.99→$19.99); (c) monthly, present a targeted alternative such as $19.99/yr; (d) weekly, present an offer appropriate to weekly. All targeting relies on paywall_id and abandoned_product_id rather than names to prevent audience leaks.

---

## Shorter weekly trial (3-day) vs longer yearly trial (7-day) offered simultaneously

**Description:** Test offering a 3-day trial on the weekly plan and a 7-day trial on the yearly plan simultaneously. This is motivated by data showing most cancellations occur in the first 1–2 days and relatively few between days 3–7. The goal is to help users self-select, balance near-term conversion with adoption of the higher-priced yearly plan, and measure net proceeds per user and plan mix impact.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a 3-day trial on the weekly plan and a 7-day trial on the yearly plan, presented simultaneously, will increase net proceeds per user and shift plan mix toward yearly without hurting near-term conversion, because most cancellations happen in days 1–2 (with relatively few between days 3–7), making a shorter weekly trial lower-risk while a longer yearly trial encourages adoption and self-selection.

**Control:** Current paywall with existing trial lengths for weekly and yearly plans (unchanged).

**Variant:** Paywall offers a 3-day trial on the weekly plan and a 7-day trial on the yearly plan simultaneously; measure net proceeds per user, plan mix impact, and near-term conversion.

---

## Auto‑Start 3‑Day Trial (Remove Toggle)

**Description:** Replace the manual trial toggle with an auto‑applied, auto‑start 3‑day free trial on load for all users to reduce friction. Teams saw this simplify the decision and, in some cases, lift starts without harming eligibility handling, with the aim of increasing trial‑to‑paid conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that auto‑applying the 3‑day free trial on load for all users and removing the manual toggle will reduce friction, simplify the decision, increase trial starts and trial‑to‑paid conversion, and not harm eligibility handling.

**Control:** Current flow where users must manually toggle on the trial to start it; eligibility handling remains as currently implemented.

**Variant:** On load, auto‑apply and auto‑start a 3‑day free trial for all users and remove the manual toggle, while maintaining existing eligibility handling.

---

## Event-triggered, feature-gated micro paywalls vs generic app-launch paywalls

**Description:** Test whether showing paywalls at key engagements/achievements (feature-gated moments) with minimal, inline treatments outperforms generic app-launch paywalls. If any app-launch placements are used, they should be contextualized (e.g., “What’s new,” personalized offers) and frequency-capped. This aims to convert at high-intent moments without harming UX.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing generic app-launch paywalls with event-triggered, feature-gated micro paywalls—and contextualizing any app-launch placements with a frequency cap when used—will increase conversion at moments of high intent without harming UX.

**Control:** - Generic app-launch paywalls (uncontextualized)
- Full paywalls at feature gates (where used)

**Variant:** - Paywalls triggered by key engagements or achievements (feature-gated moments)
- Minimal, inline micro paywalls instead of full paywalls at those gates
- If app-launch placements are used, they are contextualized (e.g., “What’s new,” personalized offers) and frequency-capped; otherwise, focus on feature-gated moments

---

## One‑time consumables where renewals underperform

**Description:** Test offering one‑time consumable purchases (no subscription) in markets with high billing issues and low renewal rates to capture upfront revenue and avoid renewal failures. Options cover 1‑month or 1‑year access, priced accordingly.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering one‑time consumable purchases for 1 month or 1 year (no subscription) in markets with high billing issues and low renewal rates will capture more upfront revenue and avoid renewal failures compared to subscriptions, because it eliminates dependence on renewals and related billing problems.

**Control:** Current subscription model (monthly or annual subscription renewals) in the identified markets with high billing issues and low renewal rates.

**Variant:** Offer one‑time consumable purchases for 1‑month or 1‑year access (no subscription), with pricing set accordingly, in those markets.

---

## Gating vs non-gating of a previously free feature

**Description:** Periodically test locking a previously free feature to quantify incremental revenue and engagement trade-offs. In some cases non-gated access performs similarly; verify with proceeds per user.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that locking a previously free feature will increase proceeds per user, with potential engagement trade-offs; in some cases, non-gated access may perform similarly. Measuring proceeds per user and engagement will reveal the net effect.

**Control:** The feature remains non-gated and free to access for all users; measure proceeds per user and engagement as the baseline.

**Variant:** The previously free feature is locked (gated) for access; measure proceeds per user and engagement and compare against the control.

---

## Add a free trial on the paywall

**Description:** Introduce a free trial on the paywall and measure the impact on conversions and proceeds per user. This was part of the early wins once pricing and packaging experiments began.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a free trial on the paywall will affect both conversions and proceeds per user because it was identified as an early win during initial pricing and packaging experiments.

**Control:** Current paywall with no free trial.

**Variant:** Paywall with a free trial option.

---

## Seasonal, time‑boxed promos with unified multi‑channel discount

**Description:** Test whether scheduling special‑occasion, time‑boxed promotions and promoting the same discount across ads, in‑app events/notifications, push, email, and social increases new user capture and total revenue during promo periods, while avoiding permanent changes to base plan pricing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running scheduled, limited‑time special‑occasion offers (e.g., major holidays, Black Friday/Christmas, seasonal kick‑offs, end‑of‑season) with the same discount consistently promoted across ads, in‑app events/notifications, push, email, and social will increase new user acquisition and total revenue lift during promo windows versus web‑only or single‑channel efforts, because it reaches new audiences at demand spikes without permanently discounting base plans.

**Control:** Promotions (if any) are limited to web‑only or a single channel and are not scheduled as time‑boxed, special‑occasion campaigns; discounts are not consistently mirrored across in‑app, email, push, social, or ads.

**Variant:** Implement a seasonal and event‑driven sales calendar that schedules time‑boxed promotions for major holidays and key moments (e.g., seasonal kick‑offs, end‑of‑season, Black Friday/Christmas). Run the same limited‑time discount across all channels—ads, in‑app events/notifications, push, email, and social—to reach new audiences and maximize revenue lift during the promo period, while keeping base plan prices unchanged outside the promo windows.

---

## Soft vs hard paywall by locale with soft-path follow-up

**Description:** Test a soft paywall with a 'No thanks' bypass against a hard-gated paywall across languages/regions. In some markets, soft can match hard on proceeds; in others, hard wins. Monitor user reviews alongside revenue to understand locale-specific tradeoffs. The soft path re-engages users later with a comparison table or a limited-time offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that allowing a 'No thanks' soft bypass and re-surfacing value later via a comparison table or limited-time offer will match hard-gated proceeds in some locales and underperform in others; tracking reviews alongside revenue will reveal where each approach is preferable.

**Control:** Hard-gated paywall with no bypass, shown per language/region, and no later comparison table or limited-time offer.

**Variant:** Soft paywall with a visible 'No thanks' bypass; users who bypass see a comparison table or a limited-time offer later in the session. Run this variant per language/region and monitor proceeds and reviews by locale.

---

## Win‑back: Post‑expiry “Last Chance” + Trial/Perk Offers vs Direct/Tailored Offer

**Description:** Test a comprehensive win‑back strategy for lapsed users identified via subscription state and auto‑renew flags. The variant layers a one‑time post‑expiry “last chance” push for a discounted offer with trial‑based reactivation paths (short repeat trial via web with deep‑link redemption; extended free trial) and exclusive perks/content, leveraging app store win‑back capabilities.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a credible one‑time “last chance” push after a real expiry and offering short or extended trials plus exclusive returnee perks—delivered via web and platform win‑back flows—will increase reactivations versus direct‑purchase or tailored promotions alone, because credibility from genuine expiry boosts response and trials let churned users re‑experience value and discover new features.

**Control:** Lapsed users (identified via subscription state and auto‑renew flags) see a direct‑purchase offer (no trial) or a tailored promotion. No one‑time post‑expiry push, no web repeat‑trial routing with deep‑link redemption, no extended free trial, no exclusive perks/content, and no use of app store first‑party win‑back capabilities.

**Variant:** Lapsed users (identified via subscription state and auto‑renew flags) receive: (1) a one‑time push immediately after a genuine expiry giving a final opportunity for the discounted offer; (2) for users who continue to use the app, routing to a web paywall offering a short new trial (web can allow repeat trials), then deep‑link back for entitlement redemption; (3) an extended free trial option for churned or inactive users so they can re‑experience value and discover new features; (4) exclusive perks/content unlocks included in win‑back offers; and (5) execution and targeting supported by the app store’s first‑party win‑back capabilities.

---

## Align Trial Length with Time‑to‑Aha: 3‑Day vs 7‑Day

**Description:** Test whether extending the trial from 3 days to 7 days improves trial‑to‑paid conversion by giving users enough time to reach the core value (“time‑to‑aha”). Ensure all user‑facing copy precisely matches the actual trial length to avoid dissonance. Monitor trial‑to‑paid conversion, retention, and cancellations.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a 7‑day trial (vs 3‑day), with messaging that clearly matches the trial length, will increase trial‑to‑paid conversion because trials longer than four days often convert better and a longer window better aligns with users’ time‑to‑aha.

**Control:** 3‑day trial length with copy explicitly stating a 3‑day trial duration; no other changes.

**Variant:** 7‑day trial length with copy explicitly stating a 7‑day trial duration; no other changes.

---

## Longer Free Trial vs Upfront Discount After Abandonment

**Description:** Test whether offering a longer free trial after an abandoned/canceled purchase performs better than offering an upfront discount. This matters because longer trials can increase perceived value without permanently lowering price, and prior tests found free trials beat discounts in abandonment flows for conversion and proceeds per viewer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a longer free trial after an abandoned/canceled purchase will increase conversion and proceeds per viewer versus an upfront discount because it increases perceived value without permanently lowering price and free trials have outperformed discounts in past abandonment tests.

**Control:** After an abandoned/canceled purchase, present an upfront discount offer.

**Variant:** After an abandoned/canceled purchase, present a longer free trial offer (longer trial duration).

---

## Feature-flagged paywall with aggressive preload and immediate offline/slow-load fallbacks

**Description:** Test implementing a feature-flagged paywall system that aggressively preloads and caches configs, assets, and all dynamic variables for instant display, including when the device is offline. When remote paywall content fails to initialize or takes longer (e.g., 15–20 seconds) on poor connections, show a native or cached fallback immediately and replace it when the remote paywall is ready. Handle errors/offline states with a clear connectivity message, and on errors present a safe alternative or skip gating to protect revenue and avoid lost conversions while reducing friction for offline users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that feature-flagging the paywall and aggressively preloading/caching its configs, assets, and dynamic variables—paired with an immediate native/cached fallback for failed or slow (15–20s) remote loads, clear connectivity messaging, and safe alternatives or skip-gating on errors—will protect revenue and avoid lost conversions by ensuring instant paywall display, including offline, and reducing friction on poor connections.

**Control:** Current paywall behavior without feature flags, aggressive preloading/caching, or native/cached fallbacks. Remote paywall content must load before display; if it is slow or fails, there is no immediate fallback or clear connectivity message, and gating behavior remains unchanged.

**Variant:** Enable a feature flag controlling the paywall system. Aggressively preload and cache the paywall, including configs, assets, and all dynamic variables, for instant display even with no network. If the remote paywall fails to initialize or takes longer (e.g., 15–20 seconds) on poor connections, show a native or cached fallback immediately and replace it when the remote paywall becomes ready. When network errors occur or the device is offline, display a clear connectivity message. On errors, present a safe alternative or skip gating.

---

## Annual-first paywall with 'View all plans' drawer and exit alternative

**Description:** Test leading with a single highest-LTV plan (commonly annual) and gating other options behind a subtle 'View all plans' control that opens a bottom drawer/sheet. The annual plan is the visual focus with a clear primary CTA; other plans (e.g., monthly/weekly) remain accessible on demand. Use accurate nudges like 'Most popular' and 'Save X%' on the annual plan. On exit/close, present a slide-up offering the lower-commitment alternative (e.g., monthly). This aims to reduce decision friction, prevent anchoring on monthly, shift plan mix toward annual, and lift ARPU while maintaining or improving initial conversion. Evaluate immediate conversion, plan mix, purchase abandonment, ARPU, and longer-term revenue, churn, and support load. Maintain accuracy to avoid review issues.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting only the highest-LTV plan by default with a clear CTA, hiding other plans (especially monthly) behind a subtle 'View all plans' bottom drawer, and adding accurate 'Most popular'/'Save X%' cues will reduce choice friction, lower purchase abandonment, increase selection of the annual plan, and raise ARPU without hurting overall conversion. Because auto-selecting yearly has previously reduced trial starts and trial-to-paid conversion in some cases, we expect that leading with a single plan plus optionality via the drawer and an exit-intent alternative will preserve or improve initial conversion while shifting the plan mix toward annual.

**Control:** Existing paywall where multiple plans (including monthly) are shown upfront without a 'View all plans' drawer/bottom sheet, and alternatives are not specifically deferred to exit; default selection and prominence cues remain as currently implemented.

**Variant:** - First screen shows only the highest-LTV plan (commonly annual) with a clear primary CTA.
- A subtle 'View all plans' link opens a bottom drawer/sheet revealing the full plan ladder; the yearly plan is pre-selected in the drawer to anchor choice while keeping other options available on demand.
- Apply accurate plan copy nudges such as 'Most popular' and computed 'Save X%'.
- If the user attempts to close, present a slide-up or subsequent view highlighting the lower-commitment alternative (e.g., monthly).

## Lengthen onboarding with purposeful steps to lift conversion

**Description:** Test whether extending onboarding by adding purposeful steps (value framing, goals, quick win) increases conversion. A prior implementation increased conversion by ~10%. Re-test using current creative to validate and seek incremental gains.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that extending the onboarding flow with purposeful steps—value framing, goals, and a quick win—will increase conversion compared to the current onboarding because a prior version of this approach increased conversion by ~10% and applying the current creative may yield incremental improvements.

**Control:** Current onboarding flow without the extended purposeful steps (no added value framing, goals, or quick-win step).

**Variant:** Onboarding flow extended with purposeful steps: value framing, goals, and a quick-win step, implemented using the current creative.

## Instrument the paywall-to-checkout funnel and target fixes by step and product

**Description:** This experiment instruments multi-page paywalls and checkout to build a step-by-step, product-level drop-off funnel and uses those insights to deploy targeted fixes. It captures micro-events across the paywall (e.g., first screen, first CTA tap on page 1, pricing, Next/page advances, purchase sheet tap, exits/close) and checkout outcomes (purchase start, purchase complete, abandon, fail due to StoreKit error/insufficient funds). Analysis compares abandonment vs. completion by product (e.g., monthly vs. annual at the purchase-sheet stage) and tracks trial starts, trial-to-paid, and product changes (including cases where switching from annual to monthly mid-trial forfeits the trial and becomes direct paid). The insights inform simpler price displays, clearer terms, alternate offers, and rescue offers to reduce abandonment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that fully instrumenting paywall and checkout steps, then using those insights to apply simpler price displays, clearer terms, alternate offers, and product-specific rescue offers (especially where annual plans show higher abandonment at the purchase-sheet stage) will reduce abandonment and improve purchase completion and trial-to-paid rates, because it reveals step-specific friction and product-level issues (including mid-trial product switches that forfeit trials).

**Control:** Current multi-page paywall and checkout without custom step events or purchase outcome events; standard price displays and terms; no targeted fixes on high-drop-off steps; no product-specific rescue offers for monthly vs. annual.

**Variant:** Add comprehensive instrumentation: paywall step events (first screen, first CTA tap on page 1, pricing view, Next/page advances, purchase sheet tap, exits/close) and checkout events (purchase start, purchase complete, abandon, fail with StoreKit error/insufficient funds). Analyze drop-off by step and by product, including monthly vs. annual abandonment at the purchase-sheet stage, trial starts, trial-to-paid, and product changes (e.g., switching from annual to monthly mid-trial forfeits the trial and becomes direct paid). Based on these insights, deploy targeted fixes on the highest-friction steps: simpler price displays, clearer terms, alternate offers, and rescue offers specifically targeting users on products with higher abandonment (e.g., annual at purchase-sheet).

## Remove trial from monthly to capture day-0 revenue

**Description:** Test whether removing the trial from the monthly plan increases immediate paid subscriptions on day 0 and improves early cash flow while keeping overall conversion near baseline.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the trial from the monthly plan will increase day-0 paid subscriptions and improve early cash flow while keeping overall conversion near baseline, because prior removal of the trial created a meaningful share of immediate paid subscriptions without materially impacting overall conversion.

**Control:** Monthly plan includes a trial period before payment; users begin on a trial before converting.

**Variant:** Monthly plan has no trial; users pay immediately on day 0 to start their subscription.

## Unified source attribution across onboarding, web paywalls, and ad keywords

**Description:** Test a unified attribution approach that: (1) adds a simple 'How did you hear about us?' onboarding question to attribute acquisition sources and analyze ARPU and conversion by source; (2) creates unique web paywall URLs per influencer/channel to track proceeds by source, replace complex offer code handling, and avoid in-app purchase fees for off-app traffic; and (3) enables breakdown of paywall conversions by campaign/ad group/keyword and match type (exact vs. broad) to shift budget toward high-converting queries and creatives.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that collecting source in onboarding, using unique per-source web paywall URLs, and enabling attribution down to campaign/ad group/keyword and match type (exact vs. broad) will (a) enable ARPU and conversion analysis by acquisition source, (b) accurately track proceeds by source without complex offer codes, and (c) increase proceeds from off-app traffic by avoiding in-app purchase fees, which will support shifting budget to higher-converting queries and creatives.

**Control:** - No 'How did you hear about us?' question in onboarding; ARPU and conversion are not attributed by source.
- Generic or shared paywall links with complex offer code handling; proceeds are not tracked by influencer/channel; off-app traffic completes purchases via in-app purchases (incurring in-app purchase fees).
- Conversion reporting lacks breakdown by campaign/ad group/keyword and match type (exact vs. broad).

**Variant:** - Add a simple 'How did you hear about us?' onboarding question to attribute acquisition sources and analyze ARPU and conversion by source.
- Create unique web paywall URLs per influencer/channel to track proceeds by source, replace complex offer code handling, and avoid in-app purchase fees for off-app traffic.
- Enable attribution that breaks down paywall conversions by campaign/ad group/keyword and match type (exact vs. broad) to inform shifts toward high-converting queries and creatives.

## Paywall Close Intercept: “Look What You’re Missing” + Loss-Framed Options + Social Proof

**Description:** When users attempt to close the paywall, intercept with a confirmation modal that (1) shows a short visual panel of key features they’ll miss (“look what you’re missing”), (2) uses loss-framed close options (e.g., “Continue with ads,” “Decline benefits”) to make trade-offs explicit, and (3) includes a strong social-proof statement. Prior testing of the “look what you’re missing” pattern increased revenue per user. This aims to rescue fence-sitters without offering discounts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a confirmation modal with social proof and a short “look what you’re missing” panel, alongside loss-framed close options (e.g., “Continue with ads” or “Decline benefits”), before allowing the close will prompt reconsideration, improve conversion, and increase revenue per user because it makes the costs of not subscribing salient and leverages social proof without discounts.

**Control:** Current paywall close behavior without any “look what you’re missing” panel, loss-framed close options, or exit confirmation modal with social proof.

**Variant:** On attempted paywall close, show an “Are you sure?” confirmation modal that includes: (a) a short visual panel of key features the user will miss, (b) a strong social-proof statement, and (c) loss-framed close options (e.g., “Continue with ads,” “Decline benefits”). Only after this is shown can the user complete the close. No discounts are presented.

## Hidden discounted "save" plan in the same subscription group to passively save ~3–5% cancels

**Description:** Maintain a lower‑price product/SKU/plan in the same subscription group that is not shown in‑app but appears in the OS/system subscription management screen. When users go to cancel or manage their subscription, some will switch to this seldom‑exposed option instead of canceling, quietly retaining a small, stable percentage (~3–5%) of would‑be churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding and maintaining a hidden, lower‑price “save” product/SKU/plan in the same subscription group—kept out of in‑app surfaces but visible in the OS/system subscription management flow—will lead a small, stable share of canceling users to select it instead of canceling, passively saving approximately 3–5% of cancels/churn.

**Control:** No hidden discounted product in the subscription group; only the standard visible plans are shown in‑app and in the OS/system subscription management screen.

**Variant:** Add a hidden “secret discount” product/SKU/plan (lower price) in the same subscription group that is not shown in‑app but appears in the OS/system subscription management screen during manage/cancel, enabling users to switch to it instead of canceling and passively saving ~3–5% of would‑be cancels.

## Layered parallel testing with persistent seed buckets, cohort-based sizing, and early stopping

**Description:** Test a framework that runs parallel experiments by assigning users to persistent 0–99 seed buckets, sizing cohorts per variant, layering long- and short-horizon tests, pausing weak variants early, and using a day‑30 cancel proxy for pricing readouts. This aims to keep cohorts mutually exclusive and stable, accelerate learning while retention data matures, and compound gains by shifting traffic to winners and combining results across tests.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using persistent 0–99 user seed buckets to isolate simultaneous experiments, allocating cohort-based sample sizes per variant, layering long‑horizon tests (e.g., pricing/plan mix) with short‑horizon tests (e.g., copy/CTA/design), pausing clear underperformers early, and using ~day‑30 post‑trial cancels as a proxy for pricing retention will accelerate learning and revenue while preserving test validity, because cohorts remain mutually exclusive and locked to their experience while data for longer‑cycle outcomes matures.

**Control:** Sequential testing without persistent user seed bucketing: run one test at a time across the full audience, keep all variants live until full trial‑to‑paid/retention readouts, and do not layer other tests while data matures or pause underperformers early; pricing tests are read only after longer‑cycle retention completes.

**Variant:** Persistent seed‑based parallelization and layering: assign stable user seeds (0–99) and allocate fixed seed ranges (e.g., target seeds ≤33) to specific tests/placements so cohorts are mutually exclusive and users remain locked to their experience; determine cohort‑based sample size per variant to know when to stop new assignments. Start a long‑horizon test that affects trial‑to‑paid (e.g., pricing/plan mix) in one seed range; when its sample size is met, pause new assignments and let cohorts mature to ~30 days after trial completion, using early cancel rate as a retention proxy. While that matures, run short‑horizon tests (e.g., copy/CTA/design) in other non‑overlapping seed ranges; queue 2–4 tests, pause clear underperformers early, and immediately shift traffic to winners. Use seed partitioning to isolate independent simultaneous hypotheses (e.g., app‑launch frequency vs transaction‑abandon), and combine winners across tests after readouts.

## Limited-time weekend discounts for new users

**Description:** Test offering time-boxed discounts (Thursday–Sunday) of 30–40% off on sign-up paywalls for new users. Prior use of this approach has shifted plan selection toward longer terms and increased revenue during sale periods.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering Thursday–Sunday, time-boxed 30–40% discounts on sign-up paywalls for new users will shift plan selection toward longer terms and increase revenue during sale periods.

**Control:** New users see the standard sign-up paywalls with no limited-time weekend discounts.

**Variant:** New users see a time-boxed discount of 30–40% off on sign-up paywalls from Thursday through Sunday.

---

## Plan-during-trial: full feature access, choose plan at end

**Description:** Test enrolling all trial users into top-tier features and prompting them to choose a plan before the trial ends, comparing conversion and plan mix to choosing a plan up front.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that giving all trial users access to top-tier features and deferring plan selection until just before the trial ends will change conversion and plan mix versus requiring plan selection up front.

**Control:** Users choose a plan up front before starting the trial.

**Variant:** All trial users are enrolled into top-tier features during the trial; before the trial ends, they are prompted to choose a plan.

---

## Monthly‑Equivalent Anchoring for Annual Plans

**Description:** A/B test adding an honest monthly‑equivalent price next to the annual plan’s full billed price to anchor affordability, clarify relative savings, reduce sticker shock on large annual totals, and steer users toward higher‑LTV annual plans—especially in markets where monthly anchoring is common—while staying compliant by keeping the billed annual price clearly visible and not misleading.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing the annual plan’s monthly‑equivalent (e.g., “$X/mo ×12”) alongside the full billed annual price, plus a clear “Save % vs monthly” indicator, will increase annual plan selection and overall conversions (improving plan mix and proceeds now and at renewal) in markets sensitive to monthly prices, because it anchors affordability, simplifies comparison with the monthly plan, and reduces sticker shock without violating review guidelines.

**Control:** Current pricing presentation with no monthly‑equivalent labels: annual shown as total price only (e.g., “$Y billed annually”), shorter plans shown with their standard prices, no “Save %” badge, and existing trial messaging as is.

**Variant:** On the annual plan card, display the per‑month equivalent next to the full billed annual price, side‑by‑side (e.g., “$12/mo ×12 — $144 billed annually”). Keep the annual total clearly visible and not overshadowed; the per‑month figure is secondary in layout but comparable in legibility, avoiding designs that show only the low monthly equivalent prominently. Within the copy, present the smallest period value first (the $/mo) while clearly labeling billing terms (billed annually). Add a savings indicator versus the monthly plan (e.g., “Save % vs monthly”). Apply the monthly‑equivalent label to longer plans (annual) only. Where the annual plan has a trial and shorter plans do not, show the monthly‑equivalent on the annual card and omit trial language from shorter plans. Target this presentation in markets where monthly anchoring resonates.

## Elasticity‑Based Discounting: Segment‑Level Forecasting and Validation

**Description:** Test an elasticity‑driven discount decision rule: estimate segment‑level price elasticity from historical campaign/discount outcomes, use it to predict conversion lift for a given discount depth, and forecast net revenue impact by balancing additional volume against lower per‑unit price; then validate whether realized quantity demanded aligns with these predictions.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that applying discounts selected using segment‑level price elasticity estimated from historical campaign data will produce actual increases in quantity demanded and conversion lift that approximate the predictions, and yield a net revenue impact consistent with the forecast, because elasticity captures how demand responds to discount depth while accounting for the trade‑off between volume and per‑unit price.

**Control:** Continue current discounts that are not determined by elasticity estimates (no elasticity‑based decision rule applied).

**Variant:** Estimate price elasticity for different user segments using historical campaign/discount data. For each segment, calculate expected incremental demand/conversion lift for a given discount depth and model the revenue impact by balancing extra volume against lower per‑unit price. Apply the resulting elasticity‑based discount and compare realized quantity demanded to the predicted values.

## Default trial length A/B: 7‑day vs 30‑day paid (monetization and ad‑signal impact)

**Description:** A/B test defaulting users to a 7‑day versus a 30‑day paid trial. Measure install‑to‑trial, trial‑to‑paid, cancels, refunds, and ad‑platform optimization signals (event volume vs value) to understand impacts on monetization and ad‑platform optimization.

**Hypothesis:** Defaulting to a 30‑day paid trial (vs 7‑day) will materially change install‑to‑trial and trial‑to‑paid conversion, cancels, refunds, and the ad‑platform optimization signal mix (event volume vs value).

**Control:** Users are defaulted to a 7‑day paid trial. Track install‑to‑trial, trial‑to‑paid, cancels, refunds, and ad‑platform optimization signals (event volume vs value).

**Variant:** Users are defaulted to a 30‑day paid trial. Track the same monetization KPIs (install‑to‑trial, trial‑to‑paid, cancels, refunds) and ad‑platform optimization signals (event volume vs value).

---

## Household monetization via family sharing

**Description:** Test adding a family‑sharing tier to monetize multi‑user use cases without deep discounting core plans.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a family‑sharing tier will monetize multi‑user use cases without deep discounting core plans.

**Control:** Current plans only; no family‑sharing tier.

**Variant:** Introduce a family‑sharing tier.

---

## Suppress competing messages on paywall/checkout and exclude checkout from web sale messaging

**Description:** Test whether prioritizing the promo flow—by suppressing feature announcements and product-update modals on paywall and purchase screens, and by targeting web in-app sale messages away from checkout pages—reduces blocking overlays and friction near purchase to protect conversion rates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that suppressing non-purchase in-app messages on paywall and purchase screens, deferring product-update modals during sale periods, and excluding purchase URLs from web in-app message targeting will protect conversion rates by preventing blocking overlays, avoiding routing users away from the paywall, and reducing friction near purchase.

**Control:** Current behavior where feature announcements or other in-app messages can overlay or route users away from the paywall; product-update walkthroughs may appear before or on top of sale paywalls; and web in-app messages promoting sales can fire on checkout/purchase pages.

**Variant:** Implement targeting and priority rules to: (1) suppress feature announcements and other in-app messages on paywall and purchase screens; (2) defer product-update modals during sale periods and prioritize the promo flow so they don’t appear before or on top of sale paywalls; and (3) deploy web in-app messages to promote sales across the site while excluding checkout/purchase URLs so they do not trigger over checkout pages.

---

## Price aligned with perceived scope (app simplicity) vs higher price

**Description:** Test a more affordable price point aligned with the app’s perceived scope/simplicity against a higher price to measure conversion and revenue trade-offs.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that choosing a more affordable price aligned with the app’s perceived scope/simplicity will increase conversion compared to a higher price because it matches the app’s simplicity.

**Control:** Offer the app at a higher price point.

**Variant:** Offer the app at a more affordable price point that matches the app’s perceived scope/simplicity.

---

## Layered frequency caps, decline/exclusion rules, and context-aware paywall delivery

**Description:** Test a unified paywall frequency framework that combines occurrence, recency, and decline caps; entitlement-based exclusions and placement filters; context-specific limits for high-frequency and non-purchasable flows; product upsell suppression after purchase; and promotional surfacing with daily caps. The goal is to reduce fatigue and dead-end experiences while preserving effectiveness, balancing UX and monetization, and enabling structured follow-ups.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that implementing layered frequency caps (occurrence, recency, and decline), entitlement-based exclusions, and context-aware limits (including high-frequency share flows and onboarding) will reduce user fatigue and dead ends while maintaining or improving monetization by maximizing reach during promotional windows without spamming sessions and allowing structured follow-ups.

**Control:** Current paywall display behavior as-is across onboarding, app open, CTA, share flows, and product upsells, without the combined frequency/decline/recency caps, entitlement exclusions, context-specific limits, or daily/time-window caps described in the variant.

**Variant:** Apply a unified policy: (1) Occurrence and decline caps: show after every N app launches in a rolling week; stop showing if the user declines more than N times in that window. (2) Recency/time-window caps: show at most once per day or once per 60 minutes; require N triggers before showing; for recurring prompts (e.g., app-open), test caps like once every 3 days vs weekly. (3) Entitlement/exclusion and placement filters: exclude active subscribers from paywalls; for product upsells, show once per user or once per N days and use an 'owns product' attribute to stop further displays after purchase; use placement filters for precise control. (4) Context-specific limits: in high-frequency share flows and in contexts where purchases can’t complete (e.g., share extensions), cap blocking paywall to every Nth time and supplement with soft paywalls; during onboarding, limit early non-gated/soft paywall to one view. (5) Promotional windows: surface seasonal offers on onboarding, CTA button, and app open with a cap of once per day. (6) Follow-ups: use time-window caps to enable structured follow-ups (e.g., discount variants).

## Timing-Optimized Paywall and 3‑Day Trial by Install Age and Onboarding (User‑Seeded A/B Test)

**Description:** Test whether timing the paywall and trial offer by onboarding stage and day‑since‑install improves conversion without hurting early retention. This combines: (1) a feature‑carousel onboarding that ends in a 3‑day free trial popup vs an immediate paywall on first open, (2) day‑since‑install gating (allow day‑1 access; gate on day‑2 or day‑3), (3) an early post‑install window (show paywall only between hours 0–15 after install), and (4) in‑session timing (trigger the paywall a few seconds after app open instead of on launch). Use user seeds so cohorts remain consistent across first‑ and second‑open flows and results can be attributed cleanly. Measure upfront conversion and subsequent trial‑to‑paid, alongside early retention.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a 3‑day free trial during onboarding, delaying general paywall exposure to post‑onboarding and day‑2/3, and limiting any early post‑install paywall to a brief 0–15h window shown a few seconds after app open will increase upfront trial starts and overall trial‑to‑paid while protecting early retention, compared to showing a paywall immediately on first open.

**Control:** Immediate paywall on first app open (paywall‑only). Paywall shown on app launch timing (no deliberate delay). No day‑since‑install gating (users can hit the paywall on day‑1). No 3‑day free trial popup during onboarding. No user‑seeded cohort consistency across first‑ and second‑open flows.

**Variant:** User‑seeded, timing‑optimized flow: • First open: show a feature‑carousel onboarding; at the end, present a 3‑day free trial popup (no paywall on app launch). • Day‑since‑install rules: allow day‑1 access (no paywall gating on day‑1); gate on day‑2 or day‑3. • Early window: if within 0–15 hours post‑install, permit a single paywall exposure a few seconds after app open. • In‑session timing: whenever a paywall is shown, trigger it a few seconds after app open (not instantly). Cohorts are assigned via user seeds to remain consistent across first‑ and second‑open flows for clean attribution.

---

## Close (X) Visibility and Delay on Paywalls

**Description:** Test the impact of delaying, hiding, removing, or relocating the close (X) on paywalls—particularly the first paywall in onboarding and soft paywalls—on instant exits, engagement, and monetization. The X can fade in after ~3–6s or 5–10s, or appear only after a certain event; alternatives include removing the X entirely or replacing it with a subtle bottom “No thanks” text link. Hold pricing/design constant to isolate the effect. Track exit behavior, engagement, trial starts, proceeds per user, abandonment, app exits, and support impact against revenue gains. Reported uplifts of ~10–15% are possible.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that delaying or reducing the visibility of the close (X) (via timed fade‑in, event‑triggered reveal, removal, or a subtle bottom “No thanks” link) will reduce instant dismissals and increase engagement, trial starts, and proceeds per user because it gives users time to see and absorb the offer, without increasing abandonment, app exits, confusion, or harming user trust.

**Control:** Immediate, always‑visible close (X) on the paywall (no delay or fade‑in). Apply to the first paywall in onboarding and soft paywalls. Pricing/design held constant across groups.

**Variant:** Multi‑arm variants (pricing/design held constant across all arms):
- A: Delayed fade‑in of the X after ~3–6 seconds.
- B: Delayed fade‑in of the X after ~5–10 seconds.
- C: No X (hard remove).
- D: Replace the X with a subtle bottom “No thanks” text link.
- E: X appears only after a certain event (event‑triggered reveal).

## No Payment Due Now + $0 CTA Free‑Trial Messaging Experiment

**Description:** Test whether explicit free‑trial reassurance and $0‑centric CTA copy placed directly above or beside the primary button outperforms generic wording. Consolidates: (1) a clear “No payment due now/today” message near/above the CTA; (2) explicit trial CTAs like “Try for $0.00,” “Try it free,” and “Start my 7‑day free trial”; (3) using a $0/free CTA on the first page of multi‑page flows with purchase completed on the last page; and (4) placement/phrasing tests (title vs subcopy vs timeline row). Applies only when a free trial is available (trial toggle on). Goal: reduce perceived risk, friction, and indecision; increase click‑throughs and conversion; and support compliance. Prior teams reported these cues perform well; make the reassurance text large and legible.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that clearly stating that no payment is due at signup and using explicit $0/free‑trial CTA copy (e.g., “Try for $0.00,” “Try it free,” “Start my 7‑day free trial”) will reduce perceived risk and indecision and therefore increase click‑throughs and conversion versus generic CTAs without reassurance when a free trial is available.

**Control:** Standard paywall with generic CTA wording (e.g., “Continue”) and no explicit “No Payment Due Now/No payment today” reassurance. If a free trial exists, it is not called out above or beside the primary CTA. In multi‑page flows, no $0/free CTA is shown on the first page.

**Variant:** When a free trial is enabled (trial toggle on), display a clear, large, legible reassurance message such as “No Payment Due Now” or “No payment today” immediately above or beside the primary CTA. Replace generic CTA text with explicit trial language: “Try for $0.00,” “Try it free” (test per locale), or “Start my 7‑day free trial.” In multi‑page flows, show a $0/free CTA on page one (e.g., “$0 • Start 7‑day trial”) and complete purchase on the last page. Test placement and phrasing of the reassurance cue (above CTA vs beside; title vs subcopy vs timeline row), and compare “Try for $0.00” against a standard free‑trial button.

---

## Entitlement-targeted upgrade paywalls with timed nudges

**Description:** Test whether entitlement-segmented, timing-controlled upgrade prompts increase relevant upgrades (without impacting other users) by showing tailored paywalls only to users on specific subscription states and plan levels.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using granular entitlements (by duration and plan level) to target upgrade paywalls—delivered at intent-aligned times and with frequency caps—will increase upgrades (monthly→annual, base/standard/legacy→premium/current, individual annual→group add-on) and improve relevance and ARPU, because only qualified users will see contextually appropriate offers (e.g., annual savings) while irrelevant offers are suppressed.

**Control:** Non–entitlement-targeted paywalls and prompts (same or broad experience across subscription states), without the targeted upgrade paths, timing rules, or suppression of irrelevant offers.

**Variant:** Entitlement-based targeting and delivery: (1) Entitlement setup: create separate entitlements by product duration (weekly, monthly, yearly, group) and plan level (base vs premium; standard vs premium; legacy vs current) to detect current state and suppress irrelevant offers. (2) Targeted upgrade paths: • Active monthly subscribers → dedicated upgrade paywall to annual, highlighting savings (e.g., 50% vs monthly). • Individual annual subscribers → group add-on offer. • Lower-tier/base/standard/legacy subscribers → premium/current tier. • Non-subscribers see the standard paywall; canceled/expired cohorts receive win-back offers once subscription status granularity is available. (3) Timing and delivery rules: • For monthly→annual, show periodic prompts every two weeks starting ~60 days after install. • Deliver on app launch or session start with a frequency cap (e.g., once per week). • Exclude very new subscribers via a days-since-install proxy. • Post‑purchase upgrades shown selectively to high‑intent cohorts (e.g., users with N sessions or on specific days since install). (4) Paywall targeting scope: show upgrade paywalls only to users on the intended entitlement state (e.g., unsubscribed only, “monthly active” only; specific plan levels such as standard vs premium, legacy vs current) to improve relevance and ARPU.

## Default fallback paywall and pricing rule for unmatched users

**Description:** Test adding a catch-all paywall and price rule so users who don’t match specified countries/segments or lack required attributes still see a valid paywall with pricing, preventing blank pricing, failed purchase flows, and lost exposure during complex rollouts and app updates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that implementing a default catch-all paywall plus a default price rule for users who are in unspecified countries/segments or lack required attributes will prevent blank pricing, failed purchase flows, and loss of paywall exposure during complex rollouts and app updates, because all unmatched users will be routed to a valid paywall with valid pricing.

**Control:** Current segmented paywall and pricing configuration with no default fallback; users in unspecified countries/segments or without the relevant attribute (e.g., age) may see blank pricing or no paywall during updates, leading to failed purchase flows and lost exposure.

**Variant:** Add a default fallback route that sends any user who doesn’t match audience filters or lacks the required attribute to a default paywall, and set a catch-all price rule for unspecified countries/segments so the default paywall always displays valid pricing.

---

## Market-Specific Pricing and Localization A/B Test (Country and Sub-Region)

**Description:** Test whether regionalized, country-specific, and sub-regional (state/city) pricing and messaging—optimized for local norms—improves conversion, proceeds per user/ARPU, and refund rates. This matters because demand curves and cultural preferences vary by market; recurring, market-specific tests help avoid one-size-fits-all outcomes and ensure each geography (including the base market) remains optimal over time.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running market-specific price points (with locally appropriate “nice number” rounding), localized messaging (wording, price anchors, social proof, and copy tone), and market-appropriate term lengths—tested independently by country and, within large countries, by state/city—will increase conversion and proceeds per user (ARPU) and reduce refund rates versus non-localized settings, because cultural and demand differences by region meaningfully influence purchase behavior.

**Control:** Current configuration per market with existing price points and terms, current copy and social proof, and no additional country/sub‑regional segmentation or localized rounding/tone changes beyond what is already live. Platform pricing alignment remains as currently configured.

**Variant:** Implement a regionally segmented test program:
- Segmentation and scheduling: Run recurring A/B tests by region and country (including the base market); re-test at least every 6 months. Do not mix countries in a single price test—create separate audiences per country (or tiered country groups) so high‑price markets don’t mask gains elsewhere.
- Sub‑regional targeting: In large countries, use IP state/city targeting to run different prices or messaging; tier major metros separately. Analyze conversion and ARPU before scaling.
- Pricing mechanics: A/B test multiple price points per market and apply locally appropriate “nice number” rounding. Don’t rely on automatic regional pricing. Where available, use bulk‑update functionality to manage price changes.
- Terms and trial structure: Test market‑specific term preferences (some regions prefer longer terms; others respond better to shorter, no‑trial options).
- Platform alignment: Align Android and iOS pricing separately if needed.
- Localization of messaging: Create localized variants that adjust wording, price anchors, and social proof by region. For Japan, emphasize customer support availability and community sentiment; for German‑speaking markets, spotlight annual value and privacy/trust elements.
- Measurement: Evaluate conversion, proceeds per user/ARPU, and refund rates by country to determine winners and rollouts.

## Trial timeline + explicit reminder promise with scheduled local notification

**Description:** Test adding an explicit paywall promise to remind users before billing and actually delivering a pre‑renewal local notification, layered onto a trial timeline paywall. Implement in a multi‑page flow that educates how the trial works, displays the exact trial end date via a timeline, and includes a dedicated “remind me before billing” step. Schedule the reminder immediately after the trial starts and request push permission post‑transaction to avoid pre‑purchase friction. Keep copy consistent between the paywall and the notification. Only show the timeline/reminder step when a trial exists; otherwise skip. Where local notifications aren’t feasible, use a copy‑driven timeline reminder in place of the notification. This aims to reduce day‑0/day‑1 cancellations, lift trial‑to‑paid, increase trust, and reduce surprise renewals/disputes without hurting conversion; also observe any effect on unsubscribes.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that explicitly promising a reminder on the paywall and sending a scheduled local reminder (e.g., ~24h–2 days before trial end, such as Day 5 of 7 or Day 2 of 3), requested post‑purchase, will reduce immediate/early cancellations, increase trial starts and trial‑to‑paid, improve perceived trust, and decrease surprise renewals and chargebacks, because it sets clear expectations and reduces perceived risk without adding pre‑purchase friction.

**Control:** Current paywall and purchase flow with no explicit reminder promise and no scheduled trial‑end reminder notification. Any existing trial timeline or end‑date copy remains as is. No push permission request tied to the trial.

**Variant:** Multi‑page paywall that: (1) educates on the intro offer and how the trial works; (2) shows a visual trial timeline with the exact end date; and (3) includes a dedicated, togglable “remind me before billing” step that explicitly states a reminder will be sent. After successful purchase/trial start, request notification permissions and schedule a local notification (no server required) timed before renewal (e.g., ~24h–2 days; Day 5 of 7; Day 2 of 3). Keep the wording consistent between the paywall and the notification. Only present the timeline/reminder step when a trial exists; otherwise skip. In locales where local notifications aren’t feasible, replace the scheduled notification with in‑paywall timeline copy (e.g., “Renews in X days”).

## Contextual paywall gating by placement

**Description:** Test using non-gated paywalls during onboarding/app launch to allow users to proceed, avoid loops, and provide a clean decline path, while using gated paywalls (no bypass) for premium features, when feature/usage limits are reached, and after any reverse-trial window to enforce monetization. Ensure the close button behavior matches the context and configure gating in paywall settings to match placement (or in code where gating is enforced).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that configuring paywall gating by context—non-gated during onboarding/app launch and gated for premium features, feature/usage limits, and post reverse-trial—will let users proceed cleanly and set correct expectations while enforcing monetization where appropriate, because the close button and gating behavior match the user’s context.

**Control:** Current paywall setup without explicit differentiation of gated vs. non-gated behavior or close-button handling by placement/context.

**Variant:** Implement contextual gating: non-gated (with close) during onboarding and app launch; gated (no bypass) when accessing premium features, when hitting feature/usage limits, and after any reverse-trial window. Ensure the close button behavior matches the context, and configure this within paywall settings (or in code if gating is enforced there).

## Deep-Link Notifications to Targeted Paywalls/Offers

**Description:** Test whether implementing URL/deep linking so notifications open the app directly to a specific paywall/offer increases conversions for time-sensitive campaigns or reactivation. Track distinct placements for notification opens and compare the targeted offer’s conversion in the current month versus the default in-app path.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that deep-linking users from notifications directly to a specific paywall/offer will increase conversion—potentially by up to 10×—compared to the default in-app experience, because it targets time-sensitive campaigns or reactivation.

**Control:** Default experience: users see the standard in-app flow and paywall. Notifications (if used) do not deep-link to a specific offer or paywall, and notification opens are not tracked via distinct placements.

**Variant:** Implement a URL scheme and deep linking. Push notifications open the app directly to a targeted paywall/offer. If a remote push service isn’t used, schedule local notifications (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, next Saturday morning) to re-open the app into the appropriate paywall placement. Use distinct placements for notification opens to track impact.

---

## Whole-number pricing and $0 trial display vs .99 pricing on the paywall

**Description:** Test replacing .99/cents endings with rounded whole numbers across the paywall and showing $0 (not $0.00) for trials. Include easy‑math plan comparisons (e.g., $60/year vs $20/month) with a “75% savings” callout and use “nice,” currency‑appropriate round numbers (e.g., 60/75/100). Prior tests reported clearer value, reduced cognitive load, shifts toward annual selection, increased proceeds/ARPU, and support for higher price ceilings without hurting overall conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing rounded whole‑number prices (e.g., $20 vs $19.99; $120 vs $119.99) and $0 (vs $0.00) for trials, using “nice” local numbers, and calling out “75% savings” on simple annual vs monthly comparisons (e.g., $60/year vs $20/month) will reduce cognitive load, align with user expectations, make value instantly clear, shift more selections to annual, and increase proceeds/ARPU without hurting overall conversion, because multiple teams observed these effects after switching from .99/cents pricing to rounded pricing.

**Control:** Paywall shows .99/cents pricing (e.g., $19.99/month, $119.99/year) and $0.00 for trials, without a “75% savings” callout and without enforcing “nice,” currency‑appropriate round numbers.

**Variant:** On the paywall UI, display rounded whole‑number prices for all plans (even if the underlying product remains at .99), e.g., $20/month and $120/year; show $0 (not $0.00) for trials; adopt currency‑appropriate “nice” round numbers (e.g., 60/75/100); and present easy‑math plan comparisons (e.g., $60/year vs $20/month) with an explicit “75% savings” callout.

---

## Feature-level one-off IAPs vs direct tier upgrade for locked features

**Description:** Test presenting feature-level one-off purchases (consumable credit packs and one-time unlocks) alongside the subscription tier upgrade when users hit locked features. This aims to capture revenue from subscription-averse users, use one-time purchases as anchors to make the subscription feel like a better deal, and create an upgrade funnel through repeat à la carte purchases—ultimately impacting revenue and retention.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering feature-level one-off purchases (credit packs or one-time unlocks, e.g., $1.99 each) alongside the tier upgrade will increase revenue and retention versus a tier-upgrade-only flow, because it monetizes users unwilling to subscribe, helps users internalize the cumulative value of “unlock everything,” and encourages repeat purchases or eventual upgrades.

**Control:** When a user encounters a feature outside their current plan, they are pushed to upgrade directly to a higher tier (tier-upgrade-only flow).

**Variant:** When a user encounters a feature outside their current plan, present alternatives alongside the tier upgrade: one-time unlocks for individual features/modes (e.g., $1.99 each) and consumable, credit-based IAPs (pay a set amount for a fixed number of uses). Position these one-off options next to the subscription to highlight the cumulative value of “unlock everything,” allow repeat à la carte purchases, and capture incremental revenue without requiring an immediate upgrade.

## Immediate vs delayed discount timing and abandoned-checkout recovery

**Description:** Compare immediate, in‑flow discounts (e.g., at session 2 and at the moment of checkout abandonment) against delayed, out‑of‑flow offers (e.g., at session 5 or after 90 days of free usage via email/push). The test spans mid‑purchase drop-offs, abandoned checkout recovery, and second‑time discounts, and includes tailoring the alternate offer to the abandoned product. This matters to balance conversion, retention, lifetime value, recovered revenue, long‑term renewals, early ROAS, and net revenue/cannibalization under different payback and retention profiles.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that delaying discounts by a few days and starting eligibility at the conversion‑rate plateau (vs. earlier/immediate) will preserve more full‑price conversions and increase net revenue with less cannibalization, while immediate discounts improve early ROAS; the optimal choice between immediate second‑time discounts and delayed discounts depends on required payback period and the app’s retention curve.

**Control:** Immediate, in‑flow discounting: present in‑app discounts early in the journey (e.g., session 2); upon checkout abandonment, show an on‑abandon, in‑flow discounted offer; when users drop mid‑purchase, launch the discount immediately; discount eligibility begins before the conversion‑rate plateau.

**Variant:** Delayed, plateau‑timed discounting and reminders: delay in‑app discount presentation to a later session (e.g., session 5); for checkout abandonment, send a delayed email/push reminder with a discounted alternate offer tailored to the abandoned product; provide an end‑to‑end discount after 90 days of free usage to compare against mid‑purchase timing; start discount eligibility at the conversion‑rate plateau; apply this delayed approach to second‑time discounts.

---

## Localized, Market‑Tailored Paywalls vs Single‑Language Control

**Description:** Test localized paywalls against a non‑localized control to quantify conversion lift by locale. The variant translates paywall copy and currency, fixes language‑driven layout issues (e.g., long German words), and adapts content by market (plan emphasis, social proof/support, trial length, and price anchoring). Measure conversion by locale and iterate copy/price per region.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that localized, market‑tailored paywalls and downstream offers— including translated copy and currency, layout adjustments for language (e.g., long German words), and region‑specific messaging (e.g., favor annual in German‑speaking markets, emphasize social proof and support in Japan, and apply price anchoring in Latin America) with trial lengths tuned by market—will increase conversion by locale versus a generic single‑language paywall because they fix perceived‑quality issues and better match regional expectations.

**Control:** Single‑language, generic paywall with standard layout, unadjusted headlines/line breaks/font sizes, non‑localized copy/currency, and no market‑specific pricing, plan emphasis, social proof/support, trial length, or translated downstream offers.

**Variant:** For top non‑English markets, ship localized paywalls and downstream offers that: (1) translate copy and currency; (2) adjust layout (headlines, line breaks, font sizes) to accommodate long words and improve perceived quality; (3) tailor content by market—favor annual in German‑speaking markets, emphasize social proof and support in Japan, apply region‑specific price anchoring in Latin America, and tune trial length by market; and (4) adjust wording, pricing, and social proof per region.

---

## Default-decline and usage-based refund protection to reduce refunds

**Description:** Test whether configuring platform refund controls—setting refund preference to decline by default and applying usage-based decisions—reduces abusive refunds (e.g., heavy post-trial usage) and increases realized proceeds compared to no preference.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that setting the refund preference to decline by default and using usage-based decisions to prevent refunds for heavy post-trial usage will reduce refunds below the level seen with no preference and increase realized proceeds, as this approach has remained lower than no preference and increases realized proceeds.

**Control:** Refund preference set to no preference; no usage-based refund decisioning applied.

**Variant:** Refund preference set to decline by default (where supported), with usage-based decisions to deny refunds for heavy post-trial usage.

---

## Gate some share items to balance virality and revenue

**Description:** Test limiting free shares to maintain virality while introducing monetization by gating additional shares or showing a non-gated paywall after an initial share.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that allowing users to share one or two items for free, then gating subsequent shares or showing a non-gated paywall after the first share, will keep virality while introducing monetization.

**Control:** Current share flow without gating based on number of items shared and without a post-first-share paywall prompt.

**Variant:** After a user shares: allow one or two items to be shared for free, then either (A) gate the rest behind a paywall, or (B) present a non-gated paywall after the first share.

---

## Use client-set attributes before triggering paywalls

**Description:** Ensure custom attributes (plan status, usage counts, cohorts, locale, etc.) are set on the device before a placement fires so segmentation and dynamic content render correctly.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that setting client-set attributes (plan status, usage counts, cohorts, locale, etc.) on the device before a paywall placement fires will ensure correct segmentation and dynamic content rendering because these experiences rely on those attributes at render time.

**Control:** Paywall placements can fire without guaranteeing that client-set attributes are present on the device at render time.

**Variant:** Before any paywall placement fires, set all relevant client-set attributes on the device (plan status, usage counts, cohorts, locale, etc.) so segmentation and dynamic content can render correctly.

---

## Immediate vs delayed win‑back timing after cancellation or inactivity

**Description:** Test whether initiating win‑back outreach and offer presentation immediately after cancellation or inactivity outperforms delayed outreach. This matters because acting while interest is fresh can increase re‑engagement, retention, and preserve recurring revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that triggering a win‑back flow immediately after cancellation or inactivity—presenting the offer right away—will increase re‑engagement and retention, preserving more recurring revenue, because speed and time‑sensitive sequencing capture users while intent is still high.

**Control:** Win‑back outreach is triggered after a delay following cancellation or inactivity, with the offer presented later (non‑immediate timing).

**Variant:** Win‑back outreach is triggered immediately upon cancellation or inactivity, and the win‑back offer is presented right away.

---

## Coordinate discount waterfall with web checkout (when compliant)

**Description:** Test aligning in‑app discount messaging with email/web and routing to web checkout for the deepest discounts (when compliant) to maximize LTV while keeping most conversions on‑platform within policy constraints.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that coordinating the discount waterfall across in‑app, email, and web—and routing users to web checkout only for the deepest discounts when compliant—will maximize LTV while retaining most conversions on‑platform, because consistent cross‑channel offers and web‑only deeper discounts can improve conversion without violating policy constraints.

**Control:** Status quo: in‑app discounting and checkout with no intentional routing to web for deeper discounts and no explicit alignment of in‑app messaging with email/web.

**Variant:** Coordinate the discount waterfall across channels: align in‑app messaging with email/web; when compliant, route users to web checkout for the deepest discounts; otherwise keep users on‑platform to preserve on‑platform conversions.

---

## Age/Intent-Segmented Paywall with SDK Audience Filtering and Soft-Gate for Underage Users

**Description:** Test segmenting paywalls by age and intent, using the SDK’s event system to filter audiences so paywalls are only shown to qualified segments (e.g., US users only, or over 18). Under-18 users get an explicitly designed flow with a soft gate (visible close) and a free path or simple bypass message, with adult-oriented/irrelevant upsells suppressed. Over-18 and higher-intent cohorts see distinct paywall messaging and higher-touch offers. This aims to ensure legal and conversion relevance, avoid UX dead-ends and support issues, and identify which messaging drives more revenue while improving engagement, ratings, and downstream conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that tagging user attributes (e.g., age and, if relevant, ethnicity) via the SDK and filtering audiences so paywalls are only shown to qualified segments, combined with age- and intent-based segmentation—routing under-18 users to a free or different experience with a soft gate and suppressing adult-oriented/irrelevant upsells, while showing higher-touch offers to higher-intent adults—will increase revenue from qualified users and improve engagement, ratings, and downstream conversion, while reducing UX dead-ends and support issues, because each cohort receives relevant and appropriate paywall experiences.

**Control:** Single hard paywall for all users with generic messaging and upsells; no age or intent segmentation; no soft-gate or bypass/free path for under-18 users; paywalls not restricted via SDK-based audience filters.

**Variant:** - Use the SDK’s event system to tag user attributes (e.g., age and, if relevant, ethnicity) and create audience filters so paywalls are only presented to qualified segments (e.g., US users only, or over 18).
- Segment by age and intent:
  - Under 18: convert the hard paywall to a soft gate with a visible close (X); show a free path or simple bypass message; suppress adult-oriented/irrelevant upsells; route to a free or different experience.
  - 18+ and higher-intent cohorts: show distinct paywall messaging and higher-touch offers.
- Compare revenue by paywall messaging, as well as engagement, ratings, and downstream conversion across segments.

## Day-of-week adaptive monetization: direct paid on weekends + shorter weekday trials

**Description:** Test a day-of-week offer strategy based on observed behavior: (1) Trials started on weekends are used later, suggesting longer weekend trials (e.g., 7-day) might better match engagement latency; (2) Direct, no-trial weekly subscriptions drive higher proceeds on weekends, while weekdays perform similarly to trial offers. This experiment configures offers by day to align with these patterns and measures ARPU uplift by day-of-week.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that aligning offer type and trial length to day-of-week engagement will increase ARPU: switching to direct, no-trial weekly subscriptions on weekends will raise proceeds, and shortening weekday trials (e.g., 3-day midweek) will maintain performance while accelerating conversion, because weekend users monetize better without trials and weekday users show similar outcomes to trials.

**Control:** Uniform offer across all days: same trial presence and trial length regardless of day-of-week (current baseline).

**Variant:** Day-of-week adaptive offers: on weekends, show a direct, no-trial weekly subscription; on weekdays, keep the trial offer but shorten midweek trial length to 3 days. Measure ARPU uplift by day-of-week.

---

## Dismiss control placement: top-right X vs bottom 'No thanks, continue for free' vs delayed X

**Description:** Compare dismiss control options on the paywall to understand their impact on user behavior. This test evaluates top-right X versus a subtle bottom 'No thanks, continue for free' text link and a delayed X. Metrics: accidental cancels/dismissals (exits), trial/purchase starts, and refund rates. Many apps see better conversion and fewer accidental dismissals with the bottom placement and wording.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing the top-right X with a subtle bottom 'No thanks, continue for free' text link—or delaying the X—will reduce accidental cancels/exits, increase trial/purchase starts, and lower refund rates, because de-emphasizing and repositioning the dismiss control reduces accidental dismissals and has led to better conversion in many apps.

**Control:** Current paywall with a top-right 'X' dismiss control.

**Variant:** Test two variants:
- Variant A: Replace the top-right 'X' with a subtle bottom text link: 'No thanks, continue for free.'
- Variant B: Keep the top-right 'X' but delay its availability/appearance.

---

## Optimize ad network signals for quality

**Description:** Test prioritizing fewer, higher‑value trial events (e.g., longer or paid trials) instead of many low‑intent events to improve optimization signals sent to ad platforms.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that favoring fewer, higher‑value trial events (e.g., longer or paid trials) over many low‑intent events will improve optimization signals to ad platforms because these events reflect higher value.

**Control:** Ad platforms are optimized using many low‑intent trial events as the primary signals.

**Variant:** Ad platforms are optimized using fewer, higher‑value trial events (e.g., longer or paid trials) as the primary signals, reducing emphasis on low‑intent events.

---

## Heavy Annual-Only Discount on Paywall to Steer Selection

**Description:** Test showing a single, large discount on the annual plan in the paywall to nudge users toward annual, while avoiding discounts on the monthly plan and requiring payment up front rather than pairing the discount with a trial. This aims to improve revenue per user, with the expectation that a bigger annual discount (e.g., 60–70%) can outweigh any trial-to-paid conversion penalty.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a single heavy discount (e.g., 60–70%) on the annual subscription on the paywall, not discounting the monthly plan, and requiring payment up front (instead of pairing the discount with a trial) will steer more users to the annual plan and increase revenue per user because the larger annual discount will outweigh any trial-to-paid conversion penalty.

**Control:** Current paywall and pricing presentation (status quo).

**Variant:** On the paywall, show only the annual plan with a single heavy discount (e.g., 60–70%). Do not discount the monthly plan. Apply the discount with payment required up front (no trial paired with the discount).

---

## Package a Compliant Full-Price Paywall to Maintain Conversion

**Description:** Test whether packaging a compliant paywall (showing full prices) with multi-page flows, exit-intent offers, and trust elements can recover performance to match or beat non-compliant layouts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding multi-page flows, exit-intent offers, and trust elements around a compliant full-price display will match or exceed the conversion of non-compliant layouts because this packaging can recover performance lost when full prices are shown.

**Control:** Non-compliant layout that does not show full prices.

**Variant:** Compliant paywall that shows full prices and is packaged with multi-page flows, exit-intent offers, and trust elements.

---

## Tier-first dynamic paywall with annual-only trial and plan-reactive content

**Description:** Test a paywall that lets users choose the plan tier first (e.g., Standard vs Higher Tier) via a segmented control, then select billing cadence (monthly/quarterly/annual). The paywall content reacts live to the selected plan and cadence: only annual shows a free trial; shorter plans (monthly/weekly/quarterly) remove trial language and swap in billing clarity. Feature lists, badges, eligibility rules, CTAs, disclosures, savings highlights, trial terms, and microcopy all update as users toggle. Visible feature deltas clarify tier value quickly. This aims to reduce confusion/support and refunds caused by misleading trial expectations, help users match to the right tier, and can lift ARPPU and overall conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a two-tier segmented control (tier first, then billing cadence) with live plan- and cadence-specific content—where free trials are limited to annual and shorter plans remove trial language and add billing clarity (e.g., “No commitment. Cancel anytime” vs “No payment due now”)—will increase overall conversion and ARPPU and decrease confusion/support contacts and refunds, because users clearly see feature differences, annual savings, and accurate trial terms as they toggle.

**Control:** Current paywall with two large side-by-side plan cards where toggling between monthly and annual in the same modal does not consistently switch page content. Trial language/affordances appear on shorter plans (e.g., monthly/weekly/quarterly) and are not removed when those plans are selected. CTAs, disclosures, feature lists, and microcopy do not reliably update based on the selected plan/cadence, contributing to users thinking a monthly plan includes a free trial.

**Variant:** - Tier-first selection via a segmented control (e.g., Standard vs Higher Tier) with a 2–4 word descriptor under each tier.
- After tier selection, choose billing cadence (monthly/quarterly/annual) with annual-only free trial eligibility.
- Differential trial eligibility: remove trial language/affordances on shorter plans (monthly/weekly/quarterly); show trial only on annual.
- Dynamic content tied to the selected product: update CTAs, disclosures, badges, feature lists, savings highlights (on annual), trial length/terms, and microcopy live as users toggle tiers/cadences.
- When monthly is selected, hide trial affordances and swap in billing clarity in CTA/subheading; when annual is selected, show free-trial language.
- Visible feature deltas under the toggle: concise bullets with missing lower-tier features greyed out or struck through.
- Ensure page content switches as plans/cadences change so the offer change is obvious, preventing confusion that previously led to support volume and refunds.

---

## Weekly Plan (7‑day or 4‑week) With Trial vs Monthly/Annual

**Description:** Test adding a weekly plan that aligns with product usage (implemented as a 7‑day or 4‑week cadence) alongside existing monthly and annual options. Weekly includes a trial; monthly has no trial. Compare conversion rates, day‑0 direct paid share, trial‑to‑pay, retention and weekly renewals, churn, and LTV. Let the test run for multiple weeks before judging, and promote the plan that delivers the best balance of revenue and churn. Ensure the weekly price is not substantially cheaper than monthly.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a weekly plan (7‑day or 4‑week) with a trial alongside monthly/annual will improve overall LTV versus monthly/annual only, even if initial weekly conversion is lower, because weekly aligns with product usage and cohorts may renew enough intervals to outperform monthly/annual on LTV.

**Control:** Current paywall offering monthly and annual plans only; monthly has no trial. No weekly option is shown.

**Variant:** Add a weekly plan (7‑day or 4‑week cadence) alongside monthly and annual. Weekly includes a trial; monthly remains no trial. Ensure the weekly price is not substantially cheaper than monthly. Run for multiple weeks and evaluate conversion rates, day‑0 direct paid share, trial‑to‑pay, retention and weekly renewals, churn, and LTV; promote the plan that yields the best revenue/churn balance.

---

## Claim-to-Activate ‘Qualified’ Trial with Paywall Lucky Draw

**Description:** Test whether a claim-required, qualification-framed free trial—surfaced via home screen card or notification and gamified on the paywall with a simple Lucky Draw awarding discounts, extended trials, or access—increases perceived value, engagement, trial uptake, and conversion versus a passive trial flow.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that requiring users to actively claim a time-limited, personalized “qualified” free trial and adding a simple “win” mechanic on the paywall will increase trial claims and subsequent conversion because the act of claiming and perceived winning boost engagement and perceived value, and the endowment effect increases trial uptake.

**Control:** Current paywall/trial flow without an active claim step, no “qualified” messaging or clear time limit, and no gamified Lucky Draw incentives (standard passive trial or purchase options).

**Variant:** Introduce a claimable trial experience: on the paywall, present a simple Lucky Draw that awards discounts, extended trials, or access; after the win, show a personalized message that the user has “qualified” for a free trial based on behavior or criteria, with a clear time limit. The offer must be actively claimed via a CTA, and the claim opportunity is also surfaced via a home screen card or notification.

---

## Default to weekly on high-intent contextual triggers

**Description:** When users hit a usage gate (e.g., ran out of free quota), test presenting an uncluttered view that leads with a weekly plan and includes a 'view all plans' option for alternatives to capture urgency.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with a weekly plan in an uncluttered view at usage gates (e.g., ran out of free quota) will better capture urgency than the current presentation because it focuses attention while still offering 'view all plans' for alternatives.

**Control:** At usage gates, keep the current experience (no dedicated, uncluttered weekly-first view; plans are presented as they are today).

**Variant:** At usage gates (e.g., ran out of free quota), present an uncluttered paywall that leads with a weekly plan and provides a clear 'view all plans' option for alternatives.

---

## Pre‑Paywall Personalization with Value‑Messaging Loader

**Description:** Test whether collecting limited personal inputs (weight, activity level, climate) before the paywall and inserting a brief loading moment that communicates the app is tailoring guidance—then showing personalized recommendations—primes perceived value and trust and increases upgrades/conversion versus a generic, neutral‑loading, non‑personalized flow.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that collecting lightweight personal data (weight, activity level, climate) pre‑paywall and using a brief loading screen that emphasizes personalized recommendations will increase perceived value, trust, and upgrades/conversion because it primes users that guidance is tailored before they see pricing, compared to a generic, neutral‑loading, non‑personalized experience.

**Control:** Current flow: no pre‑paywall data collection; neutral/plain loader; generic recommendations before pricing/paywall.

**Variant:** Proposed flow: collect limited personal data (weight, activity level, climate) pre‑paywall; show a brief loading screen messaging that the app is tailoring guidance/personalized recommendations; display personalized recommendations before the paywall.

---

## Android Crash Shield

**Description:** Test disabling the “crash‑defense” event handling on Android and handling purchase events with try/catch in the SDK to prevent paywall crashes, aiming to improve skip rates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that disabling the “crash‑defense” event handling and using try/catch in the SDK during purchase events will prevent paywall crashes and improve skip rates.

**Control:** Android app with current “crash‑defense” event handling enabled during purchase events.

**Variant:** Android app with “crash‑defense” event handling disabled and purchase events wrapped in try/catch within the SDK.

---

## Account Creation Gating: Require Upfront vs Defer Until After Purchase/Trial

**Description:** Test whether requiring account creation upfront (early hard gate) or deferring it until after purchase/trial with progressive prompts drives better funnel progression and paywall conversion. This matters because funnel distribution should guide gating: if few users reach later thresholds, early gating typically wins on total volume despite lower per-user conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that the timing of account creation gating will materially impact outcomes: when few users reach later thresholds (e.g., purchase/trial), requiring an account upfront (early hard gate) will yield higher total paywall conversion volume despite lower per-user conversion, while deferring account creation until after purchase/trial with progressive prompts will improve per-user conversion and funnel progression among users who reach those later steps.

**Control:** Require account creation upfront before users can proceed to purchase or start a trial (early hard gate).

**Variant:** Defer account creation until after the user completes purchase or starts a trial, replacing the upfront hard gate with progressive prompts leading up to that step.

---

## Long‑Time Free User Discount Offer (30‑ and 90‑Day Cohorts)

**Description:** Test targeted, time‑based discount offers to users who have remained free and not converted after 30 or 90 days. These longer‑engaged free users often respond well to time‑based incentives and convert well to paid tiers.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a discount to users who have remained free for 30 or 90 days will increase conversion to paid tiers because longer‑engaged free users respond well to time‑based incentives.

**Control:** Users who remain free for 30+ or 90 days receive no targeted discount offer; the current experience remains unchanged.

**Variant:** Users who have remained free and not converted for 30+ days receive a targeted discount offer; users who reach 90 days also receive a targeted discount offer.

---

## Weekend vs Weekday Time-Based Offer Switching

**Description:** Test the impact of switching offers by install day after analysis of proceeds by install date and day-of-week revealed higher weekend purchase intent and validated time-based offer switching (e.g., trials off on weekends).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that disabling trials on weekends will increase proceeds from weekend installs because weekend cohorts exhibit higher purchase intent.

**Control:** No time-based offer switching; the same trial offer is shown regardless of install day, including weekends.

**Variant:** Enable time-based offer switching by install day: turn trials off on weekends; keep weekday offers unchanged.

---

## Place the primary purchase CTA above the fold on landing pages

**Description:** Test whether keeping the buy button visible without scrolling (above the fold) is more effective than burying it far below the fold on landing pages, ensuring a strong, visible call-to-action remains accessible.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing the primary purchase CTA above the fold on landing pages will outperform placing it far below the fold because it keeps a strong, visible call-to-action accessible without scrolling.

**Control:** Landing pages where the primary purchase CTA (buy button) is buried far below the fold.

**Variant:** Landing pages where the primary purchase CTA is placed above the fold, strong and clearly visible, and accessible without scrolling.

---

## Optimize country-level pricing where refund rates exceed ~10%

**Description:** Test lowering prices in countries where the refund rate at the current price point is greater than ~10%, as high refunds indicate pricing is too aggressive and may harm rankings.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that lowering prices in countries with refund rates >~10% at the current price point will reduce refund rates and alleviate potential ranking harm because high refunds signal overly aggressive pricing in those markets.

**Control:** Maintain current price points in all countries, including those with refund rates >~10% at the current price point.

**Variant:** In countries where the refund rate is >~10% at the current price point, lower the price.

---

## Price strategy in growth phases: lower price for volume vs higher price with fewer buyers

**Description:** Test whether, in growth phases, favoring user growth via a lower price that significantly increases conversion while keeping proceeds per user equal or higher is better than maintaining a higher price that raises proceeds but reduces total purchasers—so we broaden the user base now to maximize future monetization options and enable later segmentation to higher‑WTP pockets.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that during growth phases, a lower price that significantly increases conversion and keeps proceeds per user equal or higher will outperform a higher price that increases proceeds but cuts buyers by broadening the user base, maximizing future monetization options, and enabling later segmentation to higher‑WTP pockets.

**Control:** Higher price that materially increases proceeds but reduces total purchasers.

**Variant:** Lower price that significantly increases conversion such that proceeds per user remain equal or higher, used to broaden the user base now with the intent to later segment up for higher‑WTP pockets.

---

## Seasonal paid intro offers in separate subscription groups

**Description:** Test offering seasonal first‑year discounts (e.g., holiday/Black Friday) as discounted, paid upfront introductory products placed in their own subscription groups. This aims to bypass store limits on intro offers per group, let past subscribers claim the promo without eligibility conflicts, renew at standard pricing to avoid devaluing the main SKU, reduce confusion for existing subscribers, and isolate promo renewals from the main SKU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing seasonal, discounted paid upfront introductory offers in separate subscription groups will (a) make the promo eligible for both new and past subscribers, (b) renew at full/standard price without devaluing or confusing the main SKU, and (c) allow isolation of renewal cohorts, because app stores limit intro offers per group and separate groups avoid eligibility conflicts and mix‑ups.

**Control:** Seasonal promotions run in the main subscription group or via permanent discounts, where intro‑offer eligibility is limited (often excluding past subscribers), renewals are mixed with the main SKU, and promos risk confusing users or devaluing the main SKU.

**Variant:** Create new subscription group(s) containing discounted, paid upfront introductory products for seasonal first‑year promos (e.g., holiday/Black Friday) and other special intro offers (e.g., win‑back, upgrades). These products renew at standard/full price, are intro‑eligible in their own group so both new and existing/past subscribers can claim them, and their renewals are isolated from the main SKU.

## Vertical stacked plan cards with aligned per‑period equivalents and savings vs horizontal layout

**Description:** Test replacing a horizontal plan layout with a vertically stacked layout that aligns headline prices, per‑period equivalents (e.g., monthly equivalent for annual; weekly equivalent on long plans), and percent savings, with clear trial badges and the target high‑LTV plan placed first and visually emphasized. Prior observations report that vertical stacks with monthly‑equivalent pricing increased annual plan selection and improved overall conversion by simplifying comparisons and reducing visual clutter/cognitive load.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting plans in a vertical stack with clear, vertically aligned comparisons—headline price, per‑period equivalent (including the annual plan’s monthly‑equivalent alongside total), and percent savings—plus visible trial badges, and placing the target high‑LTV plan at the top and most prominent, will increase overall conversion and the share of annual plan selections compared to a horizontal layout, because it simplifies comparison, highlights savings, and reduces cognitive load/visual clutter.

**Control:** Current horizontal plan layout (plan cards/selectors in a row) with existing pricing and trial display as implemented today.

**Variant:** Vertically stacked plan cards with:
- Target high‑LTV plan first/top and made the most obvious choice; other options smaller or hide cells not in focus.
- For each plan: headline price, per‑period equivalent for longer plans (e.g., monthly equivalent for annual; weekly equivalent on long plans), explicit percent savings (e.g., “Save Y%”), and clear trial badges where applicable.
- Vertically aligned headline prices, per‑period equivalents, and percent savings across plans for quick comparison.
- Example: Annual card shows “$X/month equivalent • Save Y%” versus a shorter plan without trial.

## Max-Diff–informed packaging and paywall emphasis

**Description:** Use Max-Diff to identify the most valued features and align packaging accordingly: put top-valued features in premium tiers and emphasize them in paywalls; place lower-valued features in lower tiers or free.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using Max-Diff to identify the most valued features and aligning packaging accordingly will better align feature placement and paywall emphasis with user value because top-valued features are placed in premium tiers and emphasized, while lower-valued features are placed in lower tiers or free.

**Control:** Current packaging and paywall emphasis without Max-Diff–based prioritization of features.

**Variant:** Packaging and paywall emphasis informed by Max-Diff: top-valued features are placed in premium tiers and emphasized in paywalls; lower-valued features are placed in lower tiers or free.

## External Browser vs In-App Webview for Web Checkout

**Description:** Test whether opening web checkout in an external browser (leveraging native wallets) versus an in-app webview affects checkout completion rate and proceeds when trialing web checkout.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that opening web checkout in an external browser leveraging native wallets will increase checkout completion rate and proceeds compared to an in-app webview.

**Control:** Open web checkout within the in-app webview.

**Variant:** Open web checkout in the external browser to leverage native wallets.

---

## Non-scrolling paywall with enlarged, highly legible CTAs

**Description:** Test whether removing scroll from the paywall (and the page behind it) and presenting primary plan info on a single screen, combined with larger CTA buttons (≥65 px height) and bigger, highly legible CTA text, improves conversions. On high-traffic paywalls, minor UX issues can cost conversions; enlarging CTA text/tap targets was flagged as a low‑effort improvement.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a non‑scrolling paywall (including disabled background scroll) that keeps primary plans and key benefits visible without scrolling, plus enlarged CTA buttons (≥65 px height) with larger, highly legible text, will increase tap‑through and conversions because it reduces friction, prevents key details from being missed below the fold, and improves clarity and perceived ease. If content doesn’t fit, splitting into 2–4 concise pages will maintain these benefits versus relying on scroll.

**Control:** Current paywall with existing scroll behavior and layout; current CTA button size and text size.

**Variant:** Disable background scrolling. Make the paywall itself non‑scrollable and present primary plans and key benefits on a single screen. If content doesn’t fit on one screen, split into 2–4 concise pages instead of allowing scroll. Enlarge the purchase/trial CTA: button height ≥65 px with increased, highly legible primary button text to improve tap target and clarity.

## Lean on email → web subscription funnels during sales

**Description:** Drive a significant share of conversions through email campaigns that land on a dedicated web subscription flow optimized for checkout and economics.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that directing email campaign traffic to a dedicated web subscription flow during sales will drive a significant share of conversions because the flow is optimized for checkout and economics.

**Control:** During sales, do not use a dedicated email → web subscription funnel; maintain the current approach.

**Variant:** During sales, send email campaigns that land on a dedicated web subscription flow optimized for checkout and economics.

## Offer Type Comparison for Win-Back and Introductory Flows

**Description:** Compare incentive types across win-back and introductory contexts to identify which offer drives the highest performance. Win-back offers tested: limited-time discount, extended trial, exclusive perks. Introductory offers tested: free trial, discount, both (discount + free trial). Primary outcomes: reactivation and revenue impact (win-back) and conversions (introductory).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that the type of incentive (limited-time discount, free/extended trial, both discount + free trial, or exclusive perks) will differentially affect user response, such that one option will produce higher reactivation/conversion and revenue than the others.

**Control:** Discount-only offer: limited-time discount for win-back audiences; discount as the introductory offer for new users.

**Variant:** Multi-arm variant comparing: - Free/extended trial (free trial for introductory; extended trial for win-back) - Both: discount + free trial (introductory) - Exclusive perks (win-back)

---

## Cascade offers after reverse trial if no purchase

**Description:** Test offering follow-up monetization options to users who don’t purchase at the end of the reverse trial, while focusing free-period messaging on engagement and helping users hit the 'aha' moment. Specifically, later present a short auto-renewing trial or a targeted discount.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, for users who don’t purchase at the end of the reverse trial, later presenting a short auto-renewing trial or targeted discount—and focusing all free-period messaging on engagement and helping users hit the 'aha' moment—will increase purchases.

**Control:** Existing reverse-trial flow with no later offers after non-purchase; existing free-period messaging.

**Variant:** For users who don’t purchase at the end of the reverse trial, later present a short auto-renewing trial or a targeted discount. During the free period, focus all messaging on engagement and helping users hit the 'aha' moment.

---

## Price tests by duplicating paywalls and swapping products

**Description:** Clone a paywall, change the assigned products, and route a segment to it to run price tests quickly without engineering changes.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that cloning an existing paywall, swapping its assigned products, and routing a segment to the clone will enable running price tests quickly without engineering changes.

**Control:** Users see the original paywall with its current product assignments.

**Variant:** A defined segment is routed to a duplicated paywall with swapped product assignments.

---

## First-time onboarding paywall (total paywall views = 0) vs standard paywall

**Description:** Test using total paywall views = 0 to treat the first paywall as an onboarding moment. Show an educational, multi-step explainer flow only on the first exposure, then route all subsequent views to a streamlined, monetization-focused paywall. Measure proceeds per user and early cancel rate to assess clarity upfront without adding friction later.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing an educational, multi-step explainer paywall on a user’s first paywall view (total paywall views = 0) and a streamlined paywall thereafter will increase proceeds per user and reduce early cancel rate because it increases clarity upfront without adding friction later.

**Control:** No audience filtering by total paywall views; all users see the standard, streamlined monetization-focused paywall on every paywall view.

**Variant:** Create an audience where total paywall views = 0 and treat this first exposure as an onboarding paywall: show a special educational, multi-step explainer flow on the first view only. Route all subsequent paywall views to the standard, simpler/streamlined monetization-focused layout.

---

## Always-Visible Fixed-Footer CTA vs Static CTA

**Description:** Test a floating, fixed-footer CTA (including plan selector) that remains visible while users scroll and across multi-page flows, against a standard static CTA placed at the top/bottom. This matters to improve discoverability, reduce scroll friction (especially on small devices), and capture intent. Measure completion rates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that making the primary CTA persistent in a fixed footer (with plan selector), visible while scrolling and across multi-page flows, will increase completion rates compared to a static CTA because it improves discoverability, reduces scroll friction, and captures intent—particularly on small screens.

**Control:** Standard static CTA placed at the top or bottom of the page/paywall. No floating or fixed footer. In multi-page flows, no persistent footer; CTAs are page-specific and do not progress or switch actions.

**Variant:** A floating, fixed-footer CTA that remains visible while scrolling on all device sizes and includes the plan selector. The footer persists across multi-page flows, is configured to progress between pages, and switches to a purchase action on the final page. On smaller devices, scale down content and adjust viewport thresholds so bottom CTAs remain fully visible without additional scrolling, and prevent background content from scrolling under the fixed footer (e.g., correct z-index and scroll container bounds).

---

## Interactive multi-page pre-paywall flow with feature carousel and context-first modal

**Description:** Test a multi-page, interactive/educational funnel that explains value and the sale before the paywall. The flow is reordered to: personalize → trial promise → features → notifications → paywall, with a dedicated feature carousel page inserted between the “try free” and “we’ll remind you” pages to showcase key features (e.g., Apple Watch, widgets, smart reminders). At usage limits (e.g., out of tokens), show a short context-first modal that explains the limit and primes the upgrade before the paywall. Within multi-page flows, the number of screens and whether to include a carousel matter; in prior tests, a three‑screen flow with social proof often performed best.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with personalization, then promising the free trial, showcasing key features via a dedicated carousel, requesting notifications, and finally presenting the paywall—plus inserting a short modal that explains usage limits before any usage‑gate paywall—will increase engagement and upgrade intent because users receive clear context, understand value, and are primed at the moment of friction.

**Control:** Current flow without an interactive educational ‘story’; no dedicated feature carousel page; existing onboarding screen order; and no context‑first modal before paywall at usage limits (paywall shown at the limit).

**Variant:** A multi‑page, interactive/educational funnel culminating on the paywall with this sequence: (1) Personalization, (2) Trial promise (“try free”), (3) Dedicated feature carousel page inserted between “try free” and “we’ll remind you” that visually showcases key features (e.g., Apple Watch, widgets, smart reminders), (4) Notifications permission (“we’ll remind you”), (5) Paywall. Additionally, when a user hits a usage gate (e.g., out of tokens), show a brief context‑first modal that explains the limit and primes the upgrade immediately before presenting the paywall.

---

## Second‑Chance, Time‑Gated Paywall with Early Discount vs Immediate Presentation

**Description:** Test deferring paywall exposure to non‑disruptive moments and adding an early second‑time discount (for low‑retention apps) versus showing a paywall immediately. This combines next‑launch second‑chance exposure, time‑gating to avoid mid‑round interruptions, and a short‑window discounted second offer to compare purchase rates against immediate presentation.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting paywalls only at non‑disruptive times (between rounds or after a minimum in‑session time) and as a second‑chance on the next app launch—plus offering a discounted second‑time offer within 1–3 sessions for low‑retention apps—will increase purchase rates versus immediate presentation, because users get initial exposure without mid‑round interruption and low‑retention users see a discount before they are lost.

**Control:** Immediate paywall presentation (e.g., shown right away and potentially mid‑session, including mid‑round), with no specific second‑time discounted offer.

**Variant:** Do not show a paywall in the same session as the very first app launch. Instead, present a second‑chance paywall on the next app launch. Within sessions, only show paywalls between rounds or after a minimum in‑session time (e.g., after 2 minutes), not mid‑round. For apps with low retention rates, make the second‑time offer a purchase discount shown shortly after the first session, within the next 1–3 sessions.

---

## Dedicated social proof step + succinct value proof on paywall flow

**Description:** Test inserting a dedicated social proof page in the multi‑page onboarding flow and enhancing the final paywall with concise value justification and proof points. The goal is to reinforce credibility at key decision moments using testimonials/ratings/press, context‑relevant social proof, and a compact recent‑signups bar. Prior tests cited conversion benefits and improved trial engagement when adding these trust cues.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a dedicated social proof step and succinct upgrade justification with credible proof points on the paywall will increase conversions/trial engagement because timely, relevant trust signals (testimonials/ratings/press, recent signups) and brief value framing reduce uncertainty at the moment of decision.

**Control:** Current multi‑page flow without a dedicated social proof page (e.g., using a ‘timeline’ page) and a final paywall that does not include a brief upgrade justification, testimonial/star rating, or a compact recent‑signups bar.

**Variant:** Multi‑page onboarding includes: (1) a dedicated social proof page placed before the final pricing page (often right after the intro), featuring a reviews carousel and/or badges; and (2) a final paywall enhanced with: • a brief value justification for upgrading (e.g., accountability improves outcomes) using credible proof points (research citations or social proof) without heavy copy; • a relatable testimonial or the app’s star rating; • a compact social‑proof bar showing recent signup count (e.g., “11,000 joined this week”) with small overlapping headshots that doesn’t crowd hero media. Apply social proof by context: onboarding paywalls show testimonials/ratings/press; feature‑gated paywalls use feature‑specific testimonials tied to the locked item. Optionally configure the final paywall’s social proof cluster as ratings‑forward, press badges‑forward, or testimonial‑forward.

## Exclude exit-intent during initial price discovery; then test cheaper exit-intent SKUs

**Description:** Test removing exit pop-ups/declines during initial price discovery to avoid confounding the selection of a price winner. After a winner is chosen, test exit-intent pricing by offering only SKUs priced lower than the winner.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that excluding exit-intent offers during initial price discovery will prevent confounds in selecting the initial price winner, and that after a winner is selected, offering only cheaper SKUs via exit-intent will enable clean testing of exit-intent prices without biasing the initial test.

**Control:** Initial price discovery runs with exit pop-ups/declines active.

**Variant:** Initial price discovery runs with exit pop-ups/declines removed; after selecting the initial winner, exit-intent prices are tested by offering only SKUs cheaper than that winner.

---

## Product-Limited Paywalls to Measure Cannibalization and LTV Tradeoffs

**Description:** Test whether limiting the paywall to a single plan (no choice) versus the current multi-option paywall clarifies conversion, plan mix, LTV tradeoffs, and demand segmentation. This also quantifies whether weekly/monthly cannibalize higher-LTV annuals and whether lifetime discounts cannibalize trial starts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing “solo” paywalls (annual-only, monthly-only, lifetime-only, or hiding annual) will yield clearer conversion, plan mix, and LTV signals by eliminating cross-cannibalization—revealing if weekly/monthly plans cannibalize higher-LTV annuals and if lifetime discounts are cannibalizing trial starts.

**Control:** Current paywall showing multiple options (e.g., weekly/monthly, annual, lifetime) with no options hidden.

**Variant:** Product-limited paywalls via randomized cohorts: 
- 80/10/10 split: 80% control, 10% yearly-only, 10% monthly-only to see if limiting to one product increases conversion. 
- Cohort with the annual option hidden to quantify whether weekly/monthly plans are cannibalizing higher-LTV annuals and to understand demand segmentation. 
- Annual-only vs. lifetime-only (no choice) cohorts to measure conversion, plan mix, and LTV tradeoffs and to assess if lifetime discounts are cannibalizing trial starts.

---

## Trial-first vs Feature-first vs Discount-first Paywall Messaging Across Main and Re-engagement Placements

**Description:** Compare paywall frames and creative formats across the main paywall and re-engagement placements: trial-first, feature-first, and discount-first. Measure initial conversion, trial-to-paid, and downstream retention. Keep variants isolated to measure direct lifts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that feature education improves trial-to-paid more for returning users on re-engagement placements compared to a trial-focused approach, and that across the main paywall, the three distinct frames (trial-first, feature-first, discount-first) will produce measurable differences in initial conversion and downstream retention because the messaging focus (trial, features, or discount) changes perceived value and urgency.

**Control:** Trial-first paywall messaging emphasizing the free trial (e.g., “3 days free”). On re-engagement placements, use a trial-focused timeline. This serves as the baseline on both the main paywall and re-engagement placements.

**Variant:** Two variant frames tested against the control, with placement-specific creatives: 1) Feature-first: Showcase concrete features/benefits with screenshots; on the main paywall highlight top modes/features with concrete numbers; on re-engagement placements use a feature-focused image carousel. 2) Discount-first: Limited-time offer with a timer on the main paywall. Measure initial conversion, trial-to-paid, and downstream retention; keep all non-messaging elements constant to isolate lift.

## Final-step-only Close on Multi-page Onboarding Paywalls (with Back Arrow, “No thanks,” and CTA Copy Mitigation)

**Description:** Test showing the close control only on the final step of multi-page onboarding paywalls versus an always-visible close. The goal is to reduce premature exits and improve conversion clarity while avoiding the perceived hard paywall effect that reduced post-paywall registrations by ~20%. The variant retains a natural return path via a back arrow on earlier pages, labels the final close as “No thanks,” and routes final close to an exit modal via custom dismiss logic. Progression CTA copy is adjusted (“Continue” vs “Try for free”) to mitigate hard‑paywall perception. Outside onboarding contexts (e.g., app-open or periodic prompts), the close remains visible on all pages to reduce frustration and accidental uninstalls without hurting core conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that hiding the close button until the final page in multi-page onboarding paywalls—while keeping a back arrow on earlier pages (hidden on page 1), labeling the final close “No thanks,” minimizing to an exit modal instead of logging out, and using “Continue” as the progression CTA—will reduce premature exits and increase revenue without the ~20% drop in post-paywall registrations previously seen from hard‑paywall perception. In non-onboarding contexts, keeping an always-visible close will reduce frustration and accidental uninstalls without hurting core conversion.

**Control:** Always-visible close (X) on all steps across paywall contexts. Standard dismiss behavior (close logs out/exits). Default back/close controls as currently implemented. Progression CTA copy: “Try for free.”

**Variant:** On multi-page onboarding trial paywalls: remove the close (X) from early pages; keep a Back button on pages 2–3 and hide it on page 1 to allow a natural return path; show a clear “No thanks” close only on the final page; final close minimizes an exit modal rather than logging out; use a custom dismiss action that triggers the logout flow only when intended; use “Continue” as the progression CTA to reduce hard‑paywall perception. In non-onboarding contexts (e.g., app-open or periodic prompts), keep the close visible on all pages.

---

## Timing, Frequency Caps, and Renewal Threshold for Upsell Prompts

**Description:** Test showing higher-tier or add-on upsells during and after trial on specific days (e.g., day 2 or 3) with frequency caps (e.g., every N days), and gating upgrade prompts until after ≥1 renewal to avoid premature attempts, balance revenue and UX, and improve acceptance rates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that scheduling upsell prompts on specific days with frequency caps, and only triggering upgrade prompts after ≥1 renewal, will improve acceptance rates and revenue while maintaining a good user experience because it avoids premature upsell attempts and limits prompt frequency.

**Control:** Existing upsell and upgrade prompt behavior as currently implemented (no changes).

**Variant:** Introduce timing and threshold logic: during and after trial, show higher-tier or add-on upsells on specific days (e.g., day 2 or 3); apply a frequency cap so prompts show only every N days; and trigger upgrade prompts only after the user has completed ≥1 renewal.

---

## Multi-page paywall with explicit trial-reminder reassurance

**Description:** A/B test a multi-page paywall that includes a dedicated free-trial reminder screen versus a single-page paywall. The reminder screen clearly states users will be notified before the trial ends and that no payment is due now, optionally with a simple timeline. This aims to reduce day‑0/1 “set‑and‑cancel” behavior, increase trust and trial starts, and improve trial-to-paid conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a dedicated trial-reminder reassurance step—explicitly stating “We’ll notify you before it ends” and “No payment due now” (optionally with a simple timeline)—will reduce same-day/day‑1 cancellations (including “set‑and‑cancel”), increase trial starts, and improve (or at least not hurt) trial‑to‑paid conversion because it reduces perceived risk, builds trust, and nudges users to start the trial.

**Control:** Single-page paywall with no dedicated trial reminder screen and no explicit copy indicating users will be reminded before the trial ends.

**Variant:** Multi-page paywall with a dedicated free-trial reminder page that nudges users to start the trial. The page clearly states users will receive a reminder before the trial ends and that no payment is due now, and may include a simple timeline. The reminder can be configured directly in the paywall tooling.

---

## Make the discounted plan(s) unmistakably clear on the paywall

**Description:** Explicitly label which plans are included in the sale; don’t rely on button colors or subtle cues that force users to infer eligibility.

**Hypothesis:** Explicitly labeling which plans are included in the sale on the paywall will make discounted plan eligibility unmistakably clear compared to relying on button colors or subtle cues.

**Control:** Paywall relies on button colors or other subtle cues, requiring users to infer which plans are included in the sale; discounted plans are not explicitly labeled.

**Variant:** Paywall explicitly labels which plans are included in the sale, clearly indicating discounted plan eligibility without relying on button colors or subtle cues.

---

## Dwell-based paywall prompt with immediate incentive

**Description:** Test triggering a contextual prompt when users spend time on the paywall without acting. The prompt acknowledges indecision and offers an immediate incentive (e.g., free trial or targeted discount) to encourage action.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that acknowledging indecision and offering an immediate incentive when a user dwells on the paywall will increase the likelihood of acting on the paywall compared to no dwell-based prompt, because it addresses hesitation at the moment it occurs.

**Control:** Users see the current paywall with no contextual prompt triggered by dwell time.

**Variant:** When users spend time on the paywall without acting, a contextual prompt appears that acknowledges indecision and offers an immediate incentive (e.g., free trial or targeted discount).

---

## Platform‑aware introductory offers

**Description:** Test configuring introductory offers per platform based on each platform’s constraints. Some platforms allow only one active introductory offer (e.g., free trial or discount), while others are more flexible. This experiment evaluates tailoring the introductory offer strategy to those constraints.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that tailoring introductory offers to each platform’s constraints (one active offer vs. more flexible) will yield better outcomes than a uniform setup because it aligns the offer strategy with platform limitations.

**Control:** A single, uniform introductory offer configuration applied across platforms without accounting for whether a platform allows only one active introductory offer or is more flexible.

**Variant:** Introductory offer configurations tailored by platform: platforms that allow only one active introductory offer have one active offer (e.g., free trial or discount), while platforms that are more flexible use configurations aligned with that flexibility.

---

## Short, Purposeful Onboarding to Reduce Checkout Abandonment

**Description:** Test whether replacing a long, multi-screen onboarding with a concise, purposeful flow reduces checkout abandonment without increasing drop-off. Prior observation: longer onboarding didn’t increase drop-off but did increase checkout abandonment, likely due to users tapping through quickly (tappathy).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a shorter, purposeful onboarding will reduce checkout abandonment without increasing drop-off, because longer multi-screen onboarding leads users to tap through quickly (tappathy), which previously increased abandonment while not affecting drop-off.

**Control:** Current long, multi-screen onboarding flow.

**Variant:** A shorter onboarding flow with fewer screens, keeping content concise and purposeful.

---

## Feature-flagged pricing with dual intro offer in a single StoreKit product

**Description:** Test using one StoreKit/App‑Store CK product to run price experiments: toggle a feature flag to switch the price on the fly for specific audiences, and reuse the same product’s introductory offer to show a free trial when the user is eligible or auto‑shift to a discounted price otherwise—avoiding new SKUs and a secondary product.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using a single StoreKit/App‑Store CK product with a feature‑flag price swap and an introductory offer that serves a free trial when eligible and a discounted price otherwise will let us launch price experiments without releasing a new product SKU and eliminate the need for a secondary product.

**Control:** Price experiments require releasing a new product SKU; free trial and discount are offered via separate products (intro offer used for only one, with a secondary product for the other).

**Variant:** Use a single StoreKit/App‑Store CK product. Toggle a feature flag to switch price on the fly for specific audiences. Configure the introductory offer so eligible users see a free trial; otherwise the product auto‑shifts to a discounted price. No new SKU or secondary product.

---

## Adopt Net Proceeds per User (7–8 Day) as the Primary KPI with Weekly Multi‑Variant, Guardrailed Testing

**Description:** Test shifting experiment decisioning from conversion-led metrics to net proceeds per user. Measure proceeds per new install in the first 7–8 days (or per unique paywall viewer), net of store fees and refunds, normalized for trials, with projections for renewals. Run weekly batches of 4–8 variants (traffic permitting) with do‑no‑harm guardrails. This matters because similar conversion rates can mask revenue differences, fees and refunds vary by channel, and a 7–8 day capture window covers initial weekly trial conversions for faster iteration without overcommitting to long-tail LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that choosing winners by net proceeds per user—measured in a 7–8 day window, post‑fee/refund, trial‑normalized, and projected with renewal multipliers—will increase revenue versus picking by conversion rate alone, without harming key guardrails (trial starts, plan mix, trial‑to‑paid, day‑0 cancellations, day‑30 auto‑renew), because it better captures true monetization impact and early retention signals, especially when pricing and platform fees differ by channel.

**Control:** Variants are evaluated primarily on conversion metrics (e.g., trial starts or initial purchase) and/or raw conversions, without consistently using net proceeds per user adjusted for store fees/refunds, without a standardized 7–8 day proceeds capture or renewal projections, and without formalized do‑no‑harm guardrails for trial starts, plan mix, trial‑to‑paid, day‑0 cancels, and day‑30 auto‑renew.

**Variant:** - Primary KPI: Net proceeds per user (estimated ARPU), defined as proceeds per new install in the first 7–8 days or proceeds per unique paywall viewer, net of store fees and refunds, normalized for trials.
- Projections: Include projected trial conversions and renewals (via renewal multipliers) to estimate LTV; track resubscribe behavior to validate longer‑term impact.
- Run cadence: Bundle 4–8 variants at once (if traffic allows) in ~1‑week cycles; use a 7–8 day capture window that covers initial weekly trial conversions for faster iteration; let tests run long enough for trial‑to‑paid outcomes where feasible; use confidence intervals and high confidence thresholds before rollout.
- Guardrails and supporting indicators: Monitor trial starts, plan mix (annual vs monthly), trial‑to‑paid conversion, day‑0 cancellations (trial cancel rate as an early indicator), and day‑30 auto‑renew as a retention proxy. Set do‑no‑harm thresholds (e.g., trial‑to‑paid ≥20%) and pause early if any safeguard is breached.
- Decision rule: Pick winners by net proceeds per user (post‑fee/refund) rather than conversion rate alone, while tracking proceeds per user alongside conversion—especially important when pricing and platform fees differ by channel.

## Time-based app-open offer ladder by days since install with early-bird and plateau targeting

**Description:** Test a per-user, time- and event-gated paywall cadence on app open/session start. The variant sequences offers by days since install and user state to create urgency early, avoid overlap with onboarding, and target discounts when intent is higher. It includes: a first-15-minute early-bird window; prominent, time-limited welcome offers in the first 24–72 hours; a limited-time discounted annual with a countdown and strike-through for the first N days post-install; and an escalating ladder (day 3 small discount, day 7 larger, day 14 deepest). After the initial spike, discounts are targeted to the conversion-rate plateau (~day 15) to limit cannibalization. Offers are gated with time-based filters (e.g., ≤24h, 7d, 14d, 30d+; and ≥7, 14, 30 days), optionally triggered after key events (e.g., completed onboarding, feature used N times), frequency-capped, and fall back to the standard paywall outside defined windows. Automation is via audiences and install-date filters. Compare against control using a seed-based split.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sequencing paywall offers by days since install and key events—using an early-bird window, time-limited welcome offers, a limited-time discounted annual with a countdown in the first N days, and escalating/plateau-targeted discounts (days 3/7/14 and ~day 15)—with frequency caps and onboarding exclusions will increase conversions and preserve LTV by creating genuine urgency during early intent peaks while minimizing cannibalization of early full‑price sales.

**Control:** Current experience with the standard paywall and pricing shown on app open/home screen without time-based windows, countdown timers, strike-through pricing, or an escalating cadence by days since install. No targeted plateau discounting, no event-based gating, and no specific frequency caps or exclusions to avoid back-to-back prompts after onboarding.

**Variant:** App-open/session-start offer ladder with time- and event-based gating:
- Triggers and caps: Show on app launch/session start (and optionally on the home screen for the welcome window) with frequency caps (e.g., once/day; or once every 2–3 days). Use install-date filters (e.g., ≤24h, 7d, 14d, 30d+; and ≥7, 14, 30 days) and days-since-last-view to sequence.
- Audiences and exclusions: Create audiences by days since install and since key events (e.g., completed onboarding, feature used N times). Exclude users immediately after onboarding to avoid back-to-back prompts.
- New vs returning segmentation: Show new users the best LTV combination (e.g., annual with trial). Show returners or users >7 days since install a discount or lifetime.
- Offer sequence and content:
  • Early‑bird: Within the first ~15 minutes post‑install, trigger a special offer; after the window closes, fall back to the standard paywall.
  • Welcome window (first 24–72 hours): Surface a prominent, time‑limited welcome offer at each app open or on the home screen to capture early intent.
  • Limited‑time annual (first N days since install): Show a discounted annual with the regular price struck through and a visible countdown timer; afterward revert to standard pricing.
  • Escalation on key days: Day 3 small discount, day 7 larger discount, day 14 deepest discount; normal paywall otherwise. Apply a limit of showing at most once/day.
  • Plateau targeting (~day 15): Apply discounts specifically to users who have reached the conversion‑rate plateau to capture additional conversions without cannibalizing early‑stage sales.
  • Cascading by time since install: Adjust offers over longer intervals (e.g., standard pricing in weeks 1–2; alternate promotional offer in weeks 3–6) using time-based filters (days since install/last view) to sequence.
- Urgency gating: Gate promos by days since install so early windows (<14 days) automatically stop, preserving urgency and avoiding perpetual discounts.
- Automation and split: Automate via audiences and install‑date filters; compare against control using a seed‑based split.

## Eligibility-gated trial messaging, CTAs, products, and UI

**Description:** Test rendering the paywall based on true introductory-offer eligibility and the selected product’s trial availability. When eligible, show trial-focused content and CTAs populated with dynamic trial length. When ineligible or the product has no trial, switch to a dedicated no-trial experience with direct purchase CTAs, updated copy/visuals, and immediate purchase flow. This aims to reduce confusion, review/support issues, and checkout abandonment by only showing trial promises users can actually redeem.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that gating all trial-related copy, prices, products, and UI on true eligibility (user is eligible based on device receipt/subscription group and the selected product has non-zero trial days) and switching ineligible/reactivated users to a no-trial, direct-purchase experience will reduce confusion, review/support issues, and checkout abandonment, and lower friction because messages and flows will match the user’s actual entitlements.

**Control:** Current paywall uses a single, trial-forward presentation for all users. Trial-first copy and labels (e.g., “Start free trial,” “Continue for free,” “No payment due now”) can appear regardless of intro-offer eligibility or the selected product’s trial status. CTAs, pricing text, product options, visuals (icons/badges/timeline), trial toggles, and close-button behavior are not conditioned on eligibility, and ineligible/reactivated users are not routed to a no-trial variant.

**Variant:** Runtime, eligibility-aware paywall driven by device receipt and product metadata:
- Eligibility detection and safeguards:
  - Check device receipt/subscription group for “has introductory offer” and confirm the selected product actually has trial days > 0.
  - Let the paywall decide at runtime (avoid redundant external checks).
- Trial-eligible experience (both conditions true):
  - Content/layout: show trial-focused content (e.g., trial timeline); keep price elsewhere to reduce friction; show trial toggle.
  - CTAs and copy: dynamically populate trial length from product metadata (e.g., “Join free for {trial_days},” “Try free for X days,” “Start my {{X}}-day free trial,” “Try for $0”); show “No payment due now.”
  - Products: show products with trials.
  - UI behavior: hide the close button until the last step.
- Ineligible or no-trial product experience (either condition false):
  - Routing/layout: route ineligible/reactivated users to a dedicated no-trial variant with a non-trial, social-proof layout; hide trial toggle and all trial-related sections/labels.
  - CTAs and copy: switch to direct purchase CTAs (e.g., “Continue,” “Subscribe now,” “Unlock Premium”); change “Continue for free” to “Continue”; show messages like “No commitment, cancel anytime” and “Billed monthly, cancel anytime.” Tapping Continue opens the payment sheet immediately when no trial is available.
  - Products: swap to no-trial products and update headline/plan text accordingly.
  - Visuals and behavior: remove crown/trial icons; update subheadings/badges; show the close button immediately.
- Pricing/copy compliance:
  - Gate all trial-related copy and prices behind the eligibility and product-trial checks.
  - Use “Try for $0/free” messaging only on non-transaction pages.

## App Launch vs App Open Paywall with Conservative Frequency Caps

**Description:** Test whether triggering a campaign paywall at App Launch (cold start) with conservative frequency caps outperforms an App Open/foreground trigger. This matters because App Launch events provide stronger intent signals than noisier session-based/foreground starts, and thoughtful caps (e.g., once every few days) can drive incremental revenue with minimal complaints while protecting engagement and shareability. Use seeded cohorts to keep users sticky to assignment, optimize on proceeds per user, and monitor user complaints. Start conservatively; if net-new proceeds are strong and cannibalization is low, tighten cadence.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a campaign paywall at App Launch (cold start) with conservative caps (e.g., once every few days) and intent rules will increase proceeds per user with minimal complaints versus an App Open/foreground trigger, because App Launch provides stronger intent and thoughtful frequency limits avoid overexposure and in-session disruption.

**Control:** Campaign paywall triggered on App Open (foreground), optionally representing session start behavior. No short delay. Frequency capped at once per day. No occurrence filters (e.g., not tied to number of launches in a week) and no paywall view–count gating for offers.

**Variant:** Campaign paywall triggered on App Launch (cold start). Optionally add a short delay. Apply conservative frequency caps (once every few days, e.g., every 3–5 days or once per week). Add occurrence filters (e.g., show after the 3rd launch this week) to strengthen intent. Use paywall view counts to trigger offers only after several exposures.

## Store-driven, localized paywall pricing with dynamic monthly math and savings badge

**Description:** Test replacing hardcoded paywall pricing/trial copy with store-API-driven variables that auto-localize price strings and period labels, compute monthly equivalents from yearly prices, and render a dynamic “Save X%” badge based on the active annual-to-monthly price pair. This ensures copy stays accurate across locales and currencies, reflects current test prices and product swaps, and can nudge users toward longer-term commitment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that pulling price, currency symbol, billing period, trial length, and trial end date from store APIs—and computing monthly cost and % savings vs. the shorter interval—will keep paywall copy accurate across markets and nudge more users to select yearly plans, because pricing and savings are localized, up-to-date with storefront pricing, and clearly show how much users save when selecting yearly.

**Control:** Current hardcoded paywall copy and pricing: fixed price text and trial details, manually localized or generic period labels, no computed monthly equivalent from yearly price, and no dynamically calculated percent-savings badge. Messaging may not update with active test prices or product swaps across locales and currencies.

**Variant:** - Pull all product variables directly from store APIs: price, currency symbol, billing period, trial length, and trial end date (storefront-accurate, not hardcoded).
- Auto-localize price strings; translate period labels (e.g., per month, per year) via keys so the paywall reads naturally in all locales.
- Use template functions to compute comparisons (e.g., monthly equivalent from yearly price) across locales and currencies.
- Calculate and render a dynamic percent-savings badge (e.g., “Save {X}%”) from the active annual-to-monthly price pair so it always reflects current test prices and each market’s real prices/discounts.
- Build copy with product-bound variables so messages like “Free for {trial_days} days, then {price_with_symbol} per {period}” remain accurate and instantly reflect product swaps in price tests.

## Auto-transition from $0 3-day trial to 1-month plan (remove 3-month requirement)

**Description:** Test leveraging the 30-day “hashing” with the corona (e.g., credit card promotions) alongside timeline gating: offer a $0 3-day trial that auto-transitions to a 1-month subscription after 15-seconds, removing the 3-month plan requirement. This matters as a monetization hack.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leveraging the 30-day “hashing” with the corona (e.g., credit card promotions) and timeline gating—offering a $0 3-day trial that auto-transitions to a 1-month subscription after 15-seconds—will improve monetization compared to requiring a 3-month plan because it removes the 3-month commitment.

**Control:** Current flow that requires a 3-month plan, without a $0 3-day trial and without auto-transition to a 1-month subscription.

**Variant:** Offer a $0 3-day trial and automatically transition users to a 1-month subscription after 15-seconds, leveraging the 30-day “hashing” with the corona (e.g., credit card promotions), thereby abandoning the requirement for a 3-month plan.

---

## Layered Winner Combination with Rolling Control

**Description:** Test a sequential, layered approach: isolate changes by category (e.g., pricing vs. presentation like copy/layout), promote each newest combined winner to control, then merge individually winning treatments into a single “super variant” and test it against the current control. This avoids exploding variant counts upfront, compounds gains across categories, and targets additive improvements in proceeds per user and conversion. In a prior application, combining optimized variables produced a 12.5% bump in proceeds per user and almost a 70% increase in conversion rate.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that layering experiments and then combining individually winning treatments into a single super variant—while continuously promoting the newest winner to control—will yield additive gains in proceeds per user and conversion because each variable’s impact is first isolated, then stacked to compound improvements without inflating variant counts.

**Control:** Current experience using the newest combined winner as the baseline (the most recent winner promoted to control as tests shift between categories such as pricing and design/presentation).

**Variant:** A single super variant that merges all individually validated winners from recent tests, such as the winning copy and layout together, and winning pricing/presentation treatments (e.g., rounded pricing, packaging clean‑up, annual‑first) combined into one follow‑up variant to test against the control.

---

## Paid vs Organic Discount Sensitivity and ROAS Rescue Test

**Description:** Test whether targeted discounts to paid‑acquisition cohorts that are underperforming early milestones improve paid‑ad ROAS and shorten payback, while using organic cohorts (who receive no discounts) to assess relative price sensitivity between paid and organic users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering discounts only to paid‑ad cohorts that have not yet converted within the first few days after acquisition or are not on track to meet early ROAS milestones (e.g., by day 7) will accelerate conversions, improve paid‑ad ROAS, and shorten payback because paid cohorts are more price‑sensitive than organic cohorts. Offering a discount will nudge them toward a full‑price purchase.

**Control:** No discounts are offered to any cohorts; both paid and organic users experience standard pricing during the observation window.

**Variant:** Only paid‑acquisition cohorts who have not converted within the first few days after acquisition or are not on track to meet early ROAS milestones (e.g., by day 7) receive a discount. Organic‑acquisition cohorts receive no discount. Compare outcomes to the control to evaluate improvements in paid‑ad ROAS and payback period and to assess relative price sensitivity between paid and organic cohorts.

---

## Contextual and Challenge‑Framed Messaging vs Generic Benefits (Design‑Parity, by Placement)

**Description:** Test multiple copy frames at high‑view placements (e.g., post‑feature, training primer, post‑exam) and in down‑sell (post‑abandonment), holding layout nearly identical to isolate copy/offer effects. Compare authority (“#1 rated”), outcomes/benefits, feature bullets, pain‑point, performance/aspiration, and challenge‑framed headlines with dynamic visuals (calendars/streaks) against generic benefit copy. Measure results by placement.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that contextual frames (pain‑point, performance/aspiration), authority/feature framing, and challenge‑based headlines with dynamic visuals will outperform generic benefit messaging at high‑view placements and during down‑sell, leading to higher trial starts and clearer copy/price effects because alignment to user context and urgency framing increases motivation when design is held constant.

**Control:** Current/generic benefit messaging with existing visuals at each placement; no challenge framing or dynamic visuals. Maintain the existing down‑sell layout/offer. Layouts remain nearly identical to variants to prevent design confounds.

**Variant:** Multi‑arm messaging variants by placement with design parity: authority (“#1 rated”); outcomes/benefits; feature bullets; pain‑point messaging; performance/aspiration messaging; challenge‑framed headline (e.g., “Start your 100‑day challenge today”) with dynamic visuals (calendars/streaks). For down‑sell (post‑abandonment), keep layouts nearly identical and isolate the offer/copy only. Measure by placement; for the challenge variant, observe trial starts.

---

## Universal paywall with country- and purchase-power-based product rules

**Description:** Maintain a single paywall and dynamically select the product/price by mapping storefront country (and purchase power) to specific product IDs, so the CTA purchases the correct localized price without duplicating dozens of paywalls.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using one universal paywall with rules mapping storefront country and purchase power to product IDs will ensure the CTA purchases the correct localized price and eliminate the need to duplicate paywalls.

**Control:** Multiple country-tiered paywalls (duplicated by country), each specifying a product ID.

**Variant:** A single paywall where rules map storefront country and purchase power to a specific product ID, dynamically selecting the product/price so the CTA purchases the correct localized price.

---

## Plan Badges and Discount Cue Optimization Test

**Description:** Test whether switching from generic plan labels (e.g., “Most Popular”/“Best Value”) to concrete, benefit-centric badges and adding an annual discount badge that highlights the relative savings (vs monthly or list price), along with adjusted label placement, increases perceived value, shifts plan selection, and improves overall conversion. Measure plan selection and overall conversion to assess lift.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing generic labels with specific, benefit-centric badges and displaying an annual discount cue (relative to monthly or list price), combined with adjusted label placement, will increase perceived value and clarity, leading to higher selection of the highlighted plan and improved overall conversion.

**Control:** Current paywall with existing label approach (no labels or generic labels such as “Most Popular”/“Best Value”) and no annual discount badge/cue displayed.

**Variant:** Replace generic labels with benefit-centric badges (e.g., concrete, measurable benefit claims like “Learn 2x faster” or similar). Add an annual discount badge that explicitly highlights the relative discount vs the monthly or list price. Adjust label placement (vs current placement) to test impact on perceived value.

---

## Use Separate Subscription Groups for Price Tests (Higher-Price and Segmented Lower-Price SKUs)

**Description:** Test whether placing products for materially different price tests in their own subscription groups prevents users from switching to legacy cheaper options via App Store manage-subscriptions and avoids double-billing or unintended trial eligibility, protecting revenue and preserving test integrity.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing higher-price test products and a segmented lower-priced SKU in separate subscription groups will prevent cross-grading/downgrading to legacy cheaper products and avoid double-billing or unintended trial eligibility, thereby protecting revenue and maintaining test integrity.

**Control:** Price test SKUs (higher and lower) remain within the existing subscription group, allowing users to view and switch to legacy cheaper products via App Store manage-subscriptions; this may enable downgrades/cross-grades and risk double-billing or unintended trial eligibility.

**Variant:** Create new subscription groups for all materially different price tests: place higher-price test SKUs in a separate subscription group to prevent cross-grading to legacy cheaper products, and place the segmented lower-priced SKU in its own subscription group to avoid double-billing and unintended trial eligibility.

---

## One-time paywall-close survey with response-triggered offers

**Description:** On paywall close, show a one-time survey with reasons such as “Too expensive” and “Need to try first.” Store the response and trigger a tailored offer based on it (e.g., offer a short trial only to “Need to try first” responders).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a one-time paywall-close survey and triggering response-based offers (e.g., a short trial for “Need to try first”) will outperform not doing so because the offers are based on the user’s selected response.

**Control:** On paywall close, do not show a survey and do not trigger response-based offers; proceed with the existing flow.

**Variant:** On the first paywall close, show a one-time survey with options including “Too expensive” and “Need to try first.” Store the selected response and immediately trigger a tailored offer; for example, present a short trial only to users who select “Need to try first.”

---

## Urgency Scarcity Messaging vs Neutral/Recurring Discount on Paywall and Exit/Rescue Offers

**Description:** Measure the impact of adding “one-time-only” or limited-time/limited-availability scarcity messaging to discount offers on the paywall and exit/rescue experiences, compared to neutral copy or a recurring discount framing, to evaluate the effectiveness of urgency cues and ensure no negative impact on renewal or LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding one-time-only or limited-time/limited-availability scarcity messaging to discount offers on the paywall and exit/rescue experiences will increase discount conversion rates versus neutral or recurring discount messaging, without harming renewal or LTV, because of urgency cues.

**Control:** Neutral copy with a recurring discount framing on the paywall and exit/rescue offers; no “one-time-only,” “limited-time,” or “limited-availability” language.

**Variant:** Introduce a “one-time-only” or limited-time/limited-availability scarcity disclaimer on discount offers on the paywall and exit/rescue offers, replacing neutral/recurring discount messaging.

---

## Multi-Year vs Single-Year Discount Cohort Test for High-Value Segments

**Description:** Cohort study comparing discounted multi-year plans versus discounted annual/standard plans for high-value/high-spending segments to measure long-term retention, renewal risk, and LTV. High-spending segments receive multi-year discounts while other segments receive single-year discounts, enabling comparison of long-term outcomes.

**Hypothesis:** Discounting multi-year plans for high-value/high-spending segments will increase LTV and reduce renewal risk compared to discounting the annual/standard plan.

**Control:** High-value/high-spending segments receive discounts on the annual/standard (single-year) plan.

**Variant:** High-value/high-spending segments receive discounts on multi-year plans.

---

## Paywall bullets: numeric, feature-specific value vs generic copy

**Description:** Test replacing generic paywall bullets with tangible, numbered value statements that name top modes/features. Numbers make value concrete and highlighting popular modes improves comprehension and urgency.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing generic bullets with numbered, feature-specific bullets that name top modes will improve user comprehension and urgency because numbers make value concrete and calling out popular modes clarifies what users get.

**Control:** Current paywall uses generic/abstract bullets (e.g., “Try premium”) without numbers or named modes/features.

**Variant:** Paywall uses feature/value-focused bullets that include quantities and explicit mode/feature names, e.g., “Unlock 2,000+ cards,” “Access top modes: X, Y, Z,” and “Unlock X and Y + more.”

---

## Seasonality-aware testing cadence and pricing ladder timing

**Description:** Test whether a seasonality-aware cadence—prioritizing high‑impact packaging/design tests before seasonal slowdowns and ad channel disruptions, controlling for holiday/UA-driven noise, and timing pricing/playbook adjustments—yields bigger lifts and clearer readouts. Incorporates the expectation of a summer traffic dip with often higher spend per user, maintaining strong weekly offerings, and retesting the pricing ladder (quarterly/six‑month vs yearly) before back‑to‑school.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that implementing a seasonality‑aware cadence (front‑loading high‑impact packaging/design tests before slowdowns/UA channel disruptions; comparing variants within the same timeframe; avoiding large product changes during major holidays and while paid channels are relearning; maintaining strong weekly offerings; and retesting the pricing ladder—quarterly/six‑month vs yearly—before back‑to‑school) will produce bigger lifts and clearer readouts, and better capture periods of higher spend per user (e.g., summer), than an unscheduled approach.

**Control:** Run experiments and pricing changes without seasonality adjustments: tests and product changes occur across mixed seasonal periods; large product changes may ship during holidays/heavy UA and while paid channels are relearning; variants are not constrained to the same timeframe; no specific retest of the pricing ladder before back‑to‑school; weekly offerings are not explicitly maintained.

**Variant:** Adopt a seasonality‑aware cadence: 1) Prioritize quick‑win, high‑impact packaging/design experiments ahead of seasonal slowdowns and anticipated ad channel disruptions; 2) During major holidays and heavy UA periods, avoid large product changes and compare all variants within the same timeframe; 3) Maintain strong weekly offerings; 4) Expect a summer traffic dip but often higher spend per user; 5) Retest the pricing ladder (e.g., quarterly/six‑month vs yearly) before back‑to‑school, and revisit deeper pricing experiments after major seasonal events.

---

## Session-triggered vs. time-delay discount timing for low-retention cohorts

**Description:** Test whether presenting discounts within the next 1–3 user sessions (vs. a simple time-based delay) increases conversions in low-retention scenarios by capturing value before users churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting discounts in the next 1–3 sessions will increase conversions for low-retention cohorts compared to a simple time delay because it captures value before users churn.

**Control:** Discounts are presented after a simple time-based delay, irrespective of the user’s session activity.

**Variant:** Discounts are presented within the next 1–3 user sessions for low-retention scenarios.

---

## Single-hero visual paywall + quantified proof and feature cards vs full-bleed carousel

**Description:** Test shifting from a carousel-first visual paywall to a hero-first layout and replacing text-heavy feature lists with visual feature cards. Prior observations: visual-first paywalls with minimal text and a focused CTA perform well; a single, tight hero (video/image) with a concise headline has outperformed feature carousels; and visual feature cards consistently outperform text-only bullet lists for clarity and conversion. If any carousel remains, it should be brief.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a single, tight hero video/image with a concise headline and one quantified proof point, supported by a brief mini-carousel of visual feature cards (with screenshots/short clips) highlighting premium-only capabilities, and paired with minimal text, a simple bottom drawer, and one clear primary action, will increase clarity and conversion versus a full-bleed carousel/video paywall with text bullet lists because it demonstrates value more clearly, focuses attention, and boosts trust.

**Control:** Full-bleed visual carousel/video paywall that uses multiple slides to demonstrate value, minimal supporting text, a simple bottom drawer, and one clear primary action; feature details are presented as text bullet lists.

**Variant:** Replace with a single, tight hero video/image and concise headline; add one quantified proof point (e.g., accuracy %). If any carousel is used, keep it brief. Replace long text bullet lists with modular visual feature cards (mini carousel) that highlight premium-only capabilities (e.g., “Import from social,” “Unlimited X,” “Advanced Y”) and pair each with screenshots/short clips so users see exactly what they unlock. Maintain minimal text, a simple bottom drawer, and one focused primary CTA.

---

## Channel test: email vs push for recovery

**Description:** For abandoned transactions, test email reminders against push notifications and combinations to determine the most effective recovery channel and sequencing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using push notifications and/or a defined sequence combining push and email for abandoned transactions will recover more transactions than email-only reminders, because the effectiveness of recovery communications depends on channel and sequencing.

**Control:** Email-only reminders sent for abandoned transactions.

**Variant:** Push notification reminders and/or a sequence that combines push and email for abandoned transactions.

---

## Immediate Post‑Success Conversion Prompt vs Delayed Prompt

**Description:** Test whether prompting for conversion immediately after a user’s first successful action (first water entry) outperforms waiting until later in the flow. Track conversion rates immediately after the first recorded action. This matters because users may be on an emotional high right after success, making opting in more likely.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prompting immediately after the first successful action (first water entry) will increase conversion compared to delaying the prompt because the emotional high makes opting in more likely.

**Control:** Do not show a conversion prompt immediately after the first recorded action; wait until later in the flow before prompting.

**Variant:** Show a conversion prompt immediately after the user logs a successful action, specifically the first water entry.

---

## Personalized paywall defaults by earlier choices and subscription history

**Description:** Test whether pre-selecting paywall options based on earlier expressed interest and changing the default highlighted plan based on user history reduces friction. This includes pre-selecting a higher-touch tier when previously chosen and adjusting copy/toggles, and showing different default plans to new vs. returning users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that aligning paywall defaults with prior signals—pre-selecting the higher-touch tier when previously chosen, adjusting copy and toggles accordingly, and setting the default highlighted plan based on subscription history (no-trial annual for returning subscribers; trial annual for new users)—will reduce friction.

**Control:** No personalization: the paywall does not pre-select a higher-touch tier based on earlier choices, copy and toggles are unchanged, and the default highlighted plan is the same regardless of user subscription history.

**Variant:** Personalized defaults: if a user previously chose interest in a higher-touch tier, pre-select that option on the paywall and adjust copy and toggles accordingly. Also change the default highlighted plan based on user history: show a no-trial annual to returning subscribers and a trial annual to new users.

---

## Encourage (don’t force) a key activation step before the paywall

**Description:** Test whether allowing users to skip a key activation step—while strongly encouraging completion—in the first session before the paywall improves conversion. This matters because users who completed a meaningful action in their first session were far more likely to convert, and a prior test found that forcing the action underperformed versus allowing a skip with strong encouragement.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting the key activation step before the paywall with strong encouragement and a visible skip option will result in higher conversion than forcing completion, because users who complete a meaningful first-session action are more likely to convert, and forcing the step previously underperformed versus an encouraged, skippable flow.

**Control:** Force users to complete the key activation step before the paywall with no option to skip.

**Variant:** Show the key activation step before the paywall with strong encouragement to complete it, while allowing users to skip.

---

## Short, even-split tests with early pruning and post-refund read

**Description:** Test a short-duration, full-power allocation strategy that uses even traffic splits, early pruning of clear losers, and defers the final read until after the refund window. This aims to avoid tiny allocations (5–10%) that create wide error bars, reduce revenue risk via shorter exposure, accelerate learning by reallocating traffic, and ensure net revenue outcomes include refunds.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running short (~4–5 days), full-power (e.g., 50/50) tests with even traffic splits, monitoring early to shut off clear losers and reallocate traffic, then reverting to control and reading results after the refund window (e.g., 30 days) will reduce error bars, preserve statistical clarity, reduce revenue risk, accelerate learning, and produce net revenue outcomes that incorporate refunds.

**Control:** Use tiny allocations (e.g., 5–10%) to variants over a longer test duration without early pruning; keep traffic as initially assigned and make decisions before the refund window closes.

**Variant:** Start with an even, higher allocation (e.g., 50/50) across variants for ~4–5 days at full power; monitor in the first days and shut off clear losers early to reallocate traffic; after ~4–5 days revert all traffic to control; delay decisioning and read results after the refund window (e.g., 30 days) to incorporate refunds into net revenue outcomes.

---

## Localize all downstream offers for soft paywalls in non-English locales

**Description:** When running soft paywalls outside English, ensure every subsequent offer and paywall in the flow is localized; otherwise users will exit mid-funnel.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that fully localizing every downstream offer/paywall after a soft paywall in non-English locales will reduce mid-funnel exits because users encountering non-localized (English) content are more likely to abandon.

**Control:** Soft paywall shown in a non-English locale with one or more subsequent offers/paywalls not localized (e.g., displayed in English).

**Variant:** Soft paywall shown in a non-English locale where every subsequent offer/paywall in the flow is localized to the user’s language.

---

## Explicit plan selection with a single CTA on the paywall

**Description:** Test converting plan buttons into true selectors and gating the purchase CTA until a plan is chosen. This aims to increase user commitment, prevent accidental purchases caused by plan taps starting checkout, improve clarity, and potentially shift selection toward the desired plan (often annual), with no observed harm to conversion in practice.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that making plan options true selectors and enabling a single primary purchase CTA only after an explicit plan selection will maintain or improve conversion while reducing accidental purchases, increasing clarity and user commitment, and shifting selection toward the desired plan (often annual), because users must intentionally choose a plan before proceeding.

**Control:** Plan buttons act as individual CTAs; tapping a plan immediately starts checkout, which can lead to accidental purchases and ambiguity about the selected plan.

**Variant:** Plan options function as true selectors with one primary purchase CTA placed below them. The purchase CTA remains disabled until a plan is explicitly selected.

---

## Default to express pay and hide card fields on web checkout

**Description:** Test making an express payment method (e.g., Apple Pay) the primary call-to-action and omitting credit card fields by default to streamline purchase.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that defaulting to an express payment method and hiding credit card fields by default will streamline the web checkout experience compared to showing card fields upfront.

**Control:** Web checkout displays credit card fields by default and express payment is not the primary CTA.

**Variant:** Web checkout sets an express payment method (e.g., Apple Pay) as the primary CTA and hides credit card fields by default.

---

## Post-test discounted accessory bundle with subscription

**Description:** Test whether placing the paywall after strength test completion and offering discounted accessory bundles (resistance bands, sensors) with the subscription increases conversion versus a standard subscription and generates higher per-user revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that positioning the paywall after strength test completion and offering targeted accessory bundles (resistance bands, sensors) with the subscription will increase conversion versus a standard subscription and generate higher per-user revenue because the bundle is priced at a discount relative to the base subscription.

**Control:** Standard subscription offer with no bundled accessories.

**Variant:** After the user completes the strength test, present the paywall and offer targeted accessory bundles (resistance bands, sensors) bundled with the subscription at a discount relative to the base subscription.

---

## Collapsed 'View all plans' bottom-sheet vs expanded inline plan selector

**Description:** Test an expanded-by-default inline plan selector against a collapsed initial state that leads with the annual plan and gates the full plan list behind a “View all plans” control. The goal is to balance simplicity and focus on the primary CTA with transparency and easy access to other options via a slide-up bottom-sheet, and to understand how “curious” users (who open the drawer) convert versus non‑curious users.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with the annual plan and hiding the monthly option behind a “View all plans” bottom-sheet will increase annual mix and proceeds per user without materially hurting overall conversion, because it simplifies the initial view and focuses attention on the primary CTA while preserving transparency and easy access to the full product ladder. We also expect users who open the drawer (“curious”) to convert differently than non‑curious users.

**Control:** Fully expanded, inline pricing selector showing both plans (e.g., annual and monthly) by default with no drawer—maximum transparency, both plans visible upfront.

**Variant:** Collapsed initial state focused on the primary CTA for the annual plan, with the monthly option and full product ladder hidden behind a “View all plans” trigger that opens a slide-up bottom-sheet drawer. Track conversions for users who open the drawer (“curious”) versus those who do not.

---

## ArmShield $10,000 Guarantee on Premium Paywall and Onboarding

**Description:** Test presenting a Maas protective guarantee (ArmShield) that offers $10,000 injury coverage, requires a premium subscription and compliance, and is promoted on premium paywalls and during onboarding. The goal is to lift premium upgrades and improve retention by bundling a high‑perceived‑value protection benefit into subscription eligibility.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a high‑perceived‑value ArmShield $10,000 injury coverage guarantee—bundled with premium subscription eligibility and clear compliance rules, and promoted on paywalls and onboarding—will increase premium upgrades and retention because the protection benefit reduces perceived risk and increases perceived value.

**Control:** Current premium paywall and onboarding without any protection/guarantee offer or promotion.

**Variant:** Premium paywall and onboarding display a Maas protective guarantee (ArmShield) requiring premium subscription and compliance. The offer highlights $10,000 injury coverage as an incentive. The guarantee is positioned as a bundled eligibility benefit for premium subscribers and is clearly promoted on the paywall and during onboarding.

---

## Deterministic Seeded Bucketing for Sticky Cross‑Placement Experiments

**Description:** Test replacing per‑placement randomization with a persistent, deterministic user seed (0–99) to keep users in the same cohort and price across sessions, placements, and steps. This aims to prevent users seeing different prices mid‑journey, reduce cross‑contamination, enable clean A/B splits (including frequency and long‑running offer tests), and avoid survivorship bias by assigning cohorts at install/app open. Matters because it improves test validity, preserves trust, and can reduce support load while allowing fair comparisons of overall monetization across cohorts, including users who never see a paywall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that assigning each user a persistent 0–99 seed at install/app open and routing seeds to cohorts (e.g., 0–49 vs 50–99) across all placements and sessions will keep users in the same variant and price through multi‑step journeys (e.g., onboarding paywall then app‑open paywall). Compared to non‑sticky per‑placement randomization, this will (a) produce cleaner cohort measurement—including users who never see a paywall—reducing survivorship bias; (b) prevent inconsistent pricing mid‑journey that harms trust and inflates support load; and (c) enable valid frequency and long‑running offer tests (e.g., exit‑offer splits, daily vs every 5 days frequency caps, discount ladder vs control over weeks) without audience contamination.

**Control:** Current/baseline behavior: users are randomized at the time of exposure per placement or test. Assignment is not persisted across sessions or placements, so a user may see different variants or price buckets in different placements or over time. Audience splits for features like exit offers, frequency caps, or long‑running promotions are not guaranteed to remain consistent. Cohorts are effectively defined by exposure (e.g., only paywall viewers), introducing survivorship bias and cross‑placement contamination.

**Variant:** Deterministic seeded bucketing: on install or first app open, assign each user a persistent random seed from 0–99 and store it. Route seeds to cohorts (e.g., 0–49 = Control, 50–99 = Variant) and keep this mapping stable across all sessions, placements, and steps. Apply the same seed to: (1) cross‑placement consistency (users remain in the same price/variant across onboarding paywall and later app‑open paywall); (2) frequency tests by cohort (e.g., 0–49 = daily, 50–99 = every 5 days); (3) selective exposures such as exit offers shown to only half the users; and (4) long‑running offer tests (e.g., discount ladder vs control) sustained for weeks to observe long‑tail monetization and renewal effects. Cohort assignment occurs even if a user never sees a paywall, enabling comparison of overall monetization across full cohorts.

## Compress and Prefetch Paywall Hero Media (≤2MB) via CDN/Edge Caching

**Description:** Test whether keeping paywall hero media lightweight (≤2MB) and using preloading plus CDN/edge caching to prefetch paywalls improves first impressions and stability—especially on onboarding paywalls, older/small devices, and for users outside the U.S.—to boost engagement and trial starts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that compressing paywall hero media (videos and images) to ≤2MB and preloading/prefetching via CDN/edge caching will reduce crashes, slow loads, layout issues, and stalls—especially on onboarding paywalls, older/small devices, and outside the U.S.—resulting in smoother first impressions, higher engagement, and more trial starts.

**Control:** Current paywalls use hero media that may exceed 2MB, are not consistently preloaded, and paywalls are not prefetched or cached at the edge/CDN, leading to slower initial load and potential performance/stability issues.

**Variant:** Compress all paywall hero videos and large images to ≤2MB, preload hero media, and prefetch paywalls using CDN/edge caching to avoid stalls and slow first impressions—prioritizing onboarding paywalls and coverage for users outside the U.S. and on older/small devices.

## Scarcity-based dynamic bundle offer on near-depletion

**Description:** Test a dynamic "you’ve nearly run out" message within the unlimited feature paywall that, when a user has just a few uses left, pops an alert offering an extra bundle at a discount. This evaluates whether contextual scarcity messaging at near-depletion drives uptake of the offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a dynamic "you’ve nearly run out" alert offering a discounted extra bundle when a user has just a few uses left will increase acceptance of the offer compared to not showing the alert, because scarcity-based, contextual messaging at the point of near-depletion is more compelling.

**Control:** Existing unlimited feature paywall experience without a near-depletion message or a discounted extra bundle alert when users have just a few uses left.

**Variant:** When a user has just a few uses left, show a dynamic "you’ve nearly run out" message within the unlimited feature paywall and pop an alert offering an extra bundle at a discount.

---

## Prioritize CRO before offer-code campaigns

**Description:** Test whether improving baseline conversion and ARPU first leads to better outcomes than launching influencer/offer-code programs immediately. Offer codes often contribute a small share and are messy to implement compared to CRO gains.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prioritizing CRO to improve baseline conversion and ARPU before launching influencer/offer-code programs will outperform launching offer-code campaigns first, because offer codes often contribute a small share and are messy to implement compared to CRO gains.

**Control:** Launch influencer/offer-code campaigns immediately without prior CRO optimization, relying on offer codes to drive conversions despite their implementation complexity.

**Variant:** Delay influencer/offer-code campaigns and first execute CRO improvements to raise baseline conversion and ARPU; then layer influencer/offer-code programs on top of the optimized baseline.

---

## Free Trial Restricted to Highest-LTV Product

**Description:** Test restricting free trials to only the highest-LTV product/plan instead of offering trials across multiple plans or lower-value offers, to protect margins while still leveraging trials.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that restricting free trials to the highest-LTV product/plan will protect margins while still leveraging trials, compared with offering trials on lower-value offers or across multiple plans.

**Control:** Offer free trials across multiple plans, including lower-value offers.

**Variant:** Offer a free trial only on the product/plan with the highest lifetime value; remove trials from lower-value products/plans.

---

## Deep-link offer-code redemption from paywall and in-app messages with guided restore

**Description:** Test deep-linking users to the platform/app store offer‑code redemption page from both the paywall and in‑app messages, then guiding them back with step‑by‑step instructions and a prominent Restore purchases action. This aims to reduce friction and enable quick discount launches when building a new paywall isn’t feasible.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that deep‑linking to the platform’s offer‑code redemption from the paywall and in‑app messages, paired with step‑by‑step UI instructions and a Restore purchases option on return, will reduce friction and speed up discount adoption.

**Control:** Current paywall and in‑app messaging experience with no changes.

**Variant:** Add deep links from the paywall and from in‑app messages to the app store’s offer‑code page; show step‑by‑step instructions in the UI; on return to the app, surface a Restore purchases button to complete access.

---

## "Pick your offer" chooser modal on abandon

**Description:** Test a chooser modal that offers two rescue paths (e.g., discounted first month vs. extended trial) so users self-select their preferred incentive, compared to single-offer variants.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a chooser modal with two rescue paths on abandon will outperform a single-offer rescue modal because users can self-select their preferred incentive.

**Control:** On abandon, show a single-offer rescue modal presenting one incentive (e.g., discounted first month or extended trial).

**Variant:** On abandon, show a chooser modal offering two rescue paths—discounted first month vs. extended trial—and allow users to pick their preferred option.

---

## Abandonment winback via adjacent billing-period reframing

**Description:** Test whether reframing abandoned plan choices to a better-value adjacent billing period increases recovery. For weekly-plan abandoners (when weekly is the main plan and can’t be priced much lower), present a simplified direct monthly alternative at a compelling equivalent weekly price (~50% relative savings) with strong price anchoring. For monthly-plan abandoners, follow up with an annual value plan reframed as a per-month equivalent (e.g., “$19.99/yr equals $1.67/mo”).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that reframing abandoned plan choices to adjacent billing periods—weekly → monthly at ~50% equivalent-weekly savings with strong anchoring, and monthly → annual with a clear per-month equivalent (e.g., “$19.99/yr equals $1.67/mo”)—will increase conversion because it highlights meaningful value to price-sensitive intenders.

**Control:** Existing abandonment follow-up without reframing to an adjacent billing period or presenting equivalent-per-period pricing.

**Variant:** Abandonment winback that conditionally reframes the offer: (1) If weekly is the main plan and can’t be priced much lower, offer a simplified direct monthly alternative at a compelling equivalent weekly price showing ~50% relative savings, using strong price anchoring; (2) If the user abandons a monthly plan, follow up with an annual value plan presented in a per-month equivalent (e.g., “$19.99/yr equals $1.67/mo”).

## Top-performing ad creative on paywalls: header injection vs full-body replacement

**Description:** Test whether repurposing proven ad creatives on the paywall is more effective when fully replacing the paywall body versus simply adding the creative at the top. This captures messaging continuity from ads, uses modern high-quality visuals (short video or polished imagery), aligns headlines to the creative, and leverages assets like comparison charts (e.g., daily vs weekly study) or challenge visuals. Proven ad videos (ideally 5–7 seconds with minimal text) often outperform static imagery; keep text minimal and file size optimized. Header injection can lift engagement without an app update.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that fully replacing the paywall body with the winning ad-style creative (copy or short video) will drive higher engagement and stronger value signaling than merely adding the creative above existing content, because continuity with proven ad messaging and modern, high-quality visuals (especially short, minimal-text videos that have outperformed static imagery) reinforce intent and perceived product quality.

**Control:** Paywall with injected proven ad creative in the header that pushes down the existing body. Use high-performing marketing assets (e.g., 5–7s video with minimal text or polished imagery; comparison charts or challenge visuals), align the headline to the creative, and optimize file size. This approach can lift engagement without an app update.

**Variant:** Paywall where the ad-style creative fully replaces the traditional body. Use the winning ad message and asset (copy or short video), keep text minimal, align the headline to the creative, reuse modern/high-quality visuals, and optimize file size. This version removes the original body content rather than pushing it below the creative.

## Cohort-correct trial length test: 3 vs 7 vs 30 days

**Description:** Test how changing trial length (3, 7, 30 days) affects trial conversion, starts, cancellations, and cash flow. When judging trials mid-flight, use cohort-correct conversion math and do not call results until at least 8 days post-start. Compute/measure trial conversion as conversions/(conversions + expirations) or as conversions divided by trial expirations (not starts).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that varying trial length (3 vs 7 vs 30 days) will change trial conversion, and that longer trials can raise starts but may impact cancellations and cash flow. Using cohort-correct conversion math will provide accurate cohorting when judging mid-flight.

**Control:** Current default trial length with evaluation using the cohort-correct trial conversion approach described, and no results called before at least 8 days post-start.

**Variant:** Multi-variant trial lengths: offer 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day trials (in place of the current default). Judge performance mid-flight using cohort-correct conversion math—conversions/(conversions + expirations) and/or conversions divided by trial expirations (not starts)—and wait at least 8 days post-start before calling results.

---

## Carousel End‑Position for Monthly Plan

**Description:** Test moving the monthly subscription option to the last position in the plan carousel to encourage users to scroll to the end. In a prior use of this pattern, monthly sign‑ups increased by about 20% without changing any other content.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing the monthly subscription option at the end of the carousel will increase monthly sign‑ups because it encourages users to scroll all the way to the end.

**Control:** Monthly subscription option remains in its current position in the carousel; no other content or copy is changed.

**Variant:** Monthly subscription option is positioned at the end of the carousel; no other content or copy is changed.

---

## Separate iOS trial from upgrade and frame higher‑touch tier as a clear upgrade

**Description:** Test whether avoiding in‑trial iOS upgrades that charge immediately and cancel the trial, and positioning coaching/premium as a clearly differentiated paid upgrade (not a free add to the trial), reduces confusion, cancellations, and churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that separating trial upgrades from iOS’s immediate‑charge flow and clearly framing coaching/premium as an upgrade (not a free add) with explicit inclusions will reduce confusion, cancellations, and churn.

**Control:** Allow upgrading during an iOS trial via in‑app purchase, which charges immediately and cancels the trial; upsell the higher‑touch tier as a free add to the trial without clearly differentiating what’s included.

**Variant:** During an iOS trial, do not offer an in‑app upgrade that triggers an immediate charge and cancels the trial. Instead, route users to separate post‑purchase upgrades or web add‑ons. Present coaching/premium explicitly as an upgrade and clearly differentiate what’s included.

---

## Two-Product Paywall With Tier Anchors and Outcome-Based Plan Names

**Description:** Test a paywall that promotes a new educational tier and combines a two‑product layout (one as reference price, one as main purchase) with tier names (Starter, Essentials, Elite), usage‑based plan names (Season Pass, Tournament, Year‑Round) instead of interval labels, and anchor pricing that sets a low yearly or quarterly price at a higher absolute value than monthly to attract long‑term subscribers and increase willingness to pay for higher tiers.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing two subscription products on the same paywall—using one as a reference price and the other as the main purchase—while promoting a new educational tier, naming tiers Starter/Essentials/Elite, renaming plans around usage (Season Pass, Tournament, Year‑Round) instead of monthly/quarterly/annual, and applying anchor pricing that sets a low yearly or quarterly price at a higher absolute value than monthly will increase willingness to pay for higher tiers and attract long‑term subscribers because it provides a reference price and reframes the decision around outcomes, not time.

**Control:** Current paywall showing one product at a time with interval‑based plan labels (monthly/quarterly/annual), no explicit promotion of a new educational tier, and no anchor/reference pricing tactic.

**Variant:** Paywall shows two subscription products on the same screen, using one as a reference price and the other as the main purchase. Offer tiered subscription plans named Starter, Essentials, and Elite, and promote a new educational tier. Rename plans around usage (Season Pass, Tournament, Year‑Round) instead of interval labels. Apply anchor pricing by setting a low yearly or quarterly price at a higher absolute value than monthly to attract long‑term subscribers.

---

## Prefer Storefront/Locale over IP for Pricing and Country Experiment Cohorting

**Description:** Test using the App Store’s storefront country code and device locale to determine market targeting for pricing and to assign cohorts in country experiments, instead of IP-based detection. This matters to avoid inaccuracies from travelers and VPNs and to achieve more accurate market targeting and cleaner experiment results.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using the App Store storefront country code for pricing and assigning country-based experiment cohorts by device locale or storefront will improve targeting accuracy and reduce skew versus IP-based rules because IP-based detection is affected by travelers and VPNs.

**Control:** Market targeting for pricing and country experiment cohorting is determined by IP-based detection.

**Variant:** Pricing is determined by the App Store storefront country code. Country experiment cohorts are assigned using device locale or the App Store storefront, not IP.

---

## Use IP country targeting (not device locale) for pricing, product set, and language segments

**Description:** Test switching targeting logic from device/App Store locale to IP-based country to prevent pricing/offer mismatches and ensure the correct regional product set is shown. Also test supplementing language-based segments (e.g., English vs rest) with IP country to capture English speakers outside core markets and to isolate country-specific tests cleanly.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using IP country instead of device/App Store locale to determine prices, discounts, and regional product set—and supplementing language segments (e.g., English vs rest) with IP-based country targeting—will show the correct local price/discount and product set, avoid mismatches when a user’s App Store locale differs from their country, capture English speakers outside core markets, and enable clean country-isolated tests.

**Control:** Targeting based on device locale/App Store locale and device language only. Prices, discounts, and product set are derived from device/App Store locale. The ‘English vs rest’ segment is defined solely by device language.

**Variant:** Targeting based on the user’s IP country. Prices, discounts, offers, and the regional product set are determined by IP country to avoid device-locale mismatches. For language-based segmentation (e.g., English vs rest), supplement with IP country: include English speakers outside core markets via IP-based country inclusion, and isolate tests to specific countries using IP country.

---

## Price framing: Smallest-period + everyday purchase anchor vs per-month

**Description:** Test whether framing subscription cost in the smallest period offered (e.g., per day) and anchoring it to a relatable everyday purchase increases perceived affordability and conversions compared to showing the per-month equivalent without anchors. This matters because smaller time-period framing and everyday purchase comparisons can make prices feel more approachable; in some categories, per-day framing boosts perceived affordability.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting prices in the smallest period offered (e.g., $0.33/day) and comparing the cost to a common daily purchase will result in higher conversions than presenting the per-month equivalent without comparisons, because the smaller period and relatable anchor make the price feel more affordable and concrete.

**Control:** Paywall displays the per-month equivalent pricing without any everyday purchase comparison or anchoring.

**Variant:** Paywall displays pricing in the smallest period offered (e.g., per day) and includes an anchor that compares the cost to a common daily purchase to make the price feel more relatable and concrete.

---

## Paywall layout: control vs no header image vs trial explainer above image

**Description:** Test two layout shifts against the current paywall while keeping copy constant: (1) remove the header/hero image for a text‑heavy paywall so the trial value is immediately visible, and (2) move the trial explainer above the hero visual. Prior tests indicated both shifts performed well. This builds on order‑of‑information ideas (swapping value bullets, trial explainer, and image; swapping the trial timeline with the introductory headline or image). If both variants beat control, combine them in a follow‑up.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that surfacing the trial explanation earlier—either by placing it above the hero visual or by removing the header image—will increase conversion because the trial value is immediately visible.

**Control:** Current paywall with a header/hero image present and the trial explainer below the image; existing order of headline, value bullets, and copy unchanged.

**Variant:** Multi‑arm test (copy held constant across all arms):
- Variant A: No‑header, text‑heavy paywall—remove the header/hero image entirely so trial value is immediately visible.
- Variant B: Trial explainer above image—swap placement so the trial explainer appears above the hero visual.

---

## Audience-Researched Paywall vs. Generic Template

**Description:** Test whether a paywall tailored from audience research outperforms a generic, widely copied industry template, reinforcing the guidance to avoid duplicating popular templates and instead design for a specific audience and value proposition.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a paywall designed from audience research will outperform a generic, widely copied industry template because it fits the specific audience and value proposition.

**Control:** A generic, widely copied industry paywall template.

**Variant:** A paywall designed from audience research, tailored to the specific audience and value proposition.

---

## Device-class segmented paywall terms in Android-heavy markets

**Description:** Test presenting different default subscription terms and paywall emphasis based on device tier in Android-heavy markets: emphasize and default to shorter commitments (monthly/quarterly) with supporting messaging on low-end/older/budget devices, while keeping yearly as the default on high-end devices. Measure impact on conversion and ARPU across heterogeneous markets.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that segmenting paywall terms by device class—showing shorter-term defaults and more prominent monthly/quarterly options with shorter-commitment messaging on low-end/older/budget devices, and keeping yearly as the default on high-end devices—in Android-heavy markets will improve conversion and ARPU because it aligns offers to buying power across heterogeneous markets.

**Control:** Non-segmented paywall: the same offer presentation and default term are shown to all devices, with no device-based changes to term prominence or messaging.

**Variant:** Device-based offer presentation: for low-end/older/budget devices, default to shorter terms and make monthly and quarterly options more prominent with messaging around shorter commitment; for high-end devices, keep yearly as the default.

---

## Post‑Dismiss Exit Discount: 60% Lifetime Downsell vs No Offer

**Description:** Test showing a post‑dismiss/exit second‑chance offer after a paywall close: a discounted lifetime downsell via a “clear a 60% discount” button, versus showing no promotion. Measure impact on likelihood to pay on a second pass and on churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a clear 60% discounted lifetime offer on the post‑dismiss/exit screen after a paywall close will increase second‑pass payments and reduce churn compared to showing no promotion, because a post‑dismiss second‑chance offer may prompt payment.

**Control:** After the user closes the paywall, show a post‑dismiss/exit screen with no promotion (no second‑chance or exit discount).

**Variant:** After the user closes the paywall, show a post‑dismiss/exit screen with a “clear a 60% discount” button that presents a discounted lifetime downsell offer.

---

## Video‑first paywall: short silent demo vs static/timeline‑first

**Description:** Test replacing the current static or timeline‑first paywall with a video‑first, multi‑page flow that leads with a short product demo (or lightweight Lottie) showing real app UI above the fold. Keep the motion asset lightweight (≈2 MB or less), short (5–7 seconds), silent with captions, and paired with minimal copy. Use a subtle background blur if needed for text legibility. Page 1 focuses on value with a clear “Start your free week” CTA; subsequent pages provide reassurance and pricing/plan selection. This captures insights to compare motion vs static, video‑only vs video‑plus‑copy, and single video vs feature carousel, while ensuring assets emphasize actual product flows over lifestyle imagery.

**Hypothesis:** We believe leading the paywall with a short, silent 5–7s demo (or lightweight Lottie) that shows real app screens—paired with minimal text and a “Start your free week” CTA, with pricing deferred to later screens—will increase engagement and conversion versus a static or timeline‑first paywall, because motion draws attention to the value prop and real UI sets clear expectations and improves understanding.

**Control:** Current paywall with static imagery or text‑only content (timeline‑first/static flow), where pricing appears early and there is no above‑the‑fold product demo or motion element.

**Variant:** Multi‑page, video‑first paywall. Page 1: hero motion creative above the fold—a short (5–7s), silent, captioned product demo video or lightweight Lottie showing core flows using real UI; minimal supporting copy; optional subtle background blur for readability; primary CTA: “Start your free week.” Subsequent pages: reassurance and pricing/plan selection. Motion asset kept lightweight (≈2 MB or less). Creative options to capture within this variant include video‑only vs video‑plus‑copy and single hero video vs a feature carousel, prioritizing real UI over lifestyle imagery.

---

## One-time Paywall-Close Micro-Survey with Tailored Re-Offers and Segmented Follow-ups

**Description:** When users dismiss the paywall, ask a one-time micro-survey to capture why they dismissed, then use those responses to tailor follow-ups (e.g., discount, longer trial, courtesy free action), retarget via CRM or a promotional paywall on next open, and feed a feedback loop to iterate copy/messaging and prioritize whether to test trial length, pricing, or messaging. Run separately for onboarding and legacy segments to get clearer signals.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that asking a one-time micro-survey at paywall close and routing users to tailored follow-ups based on their stated objection will better address objections and produce clearer signals for prioritizing trial length, pricing, or messaging tests because it captures intent (e.g., “Too expensive,” “Need to try first,” “Not sure what I get,” “I don’t pay for apps”) and includes open text to inform copy and messaging iterations.

**Control:** On paywall dismissal, no survey is shown; users receive no reason-based follow-ups, and subsequent experiences are not tailored by dismissal reason or by onboarding vs. legacy segment.

**Variant:** Upon closing the paywall (once per user), show a one-question micro-survey with choices such as “Too expensive,” “Need to try first/need more time,” “Not sure what I get,” and “I don’t pay for apps,” plus an open-text field. Based on the selected reason: - “Too expensive” → show a price discount. - “Need to try first/need more time” → offer a longer trial. - “I don’t pay for apps” → provide a courtesy free action. Use responses to: (a) trigger a tailored re-offer immediately or on next open via a promotional paywall, (b) retarget via CRM, and (c) iterate paywall copy/messaging and decide whether to prioritize trial length, pricing, or messaging tests. Run separate surveys for onboarding and legacy segments.

---

## Contextual Trust Copy + Transparent Terms on the Paywall

**Description:** Test whether prominently surfacing clear, store-compliant subscription terms and contextual, risk-reducing microcopy near the CTA improves conversion and reduces refunds. This combines: dynamic trial-state copy (“No payment due now” when a free trial applies; otherwise “No commitment, cancel anytime”/“Cancel anytime”); explicit trial length, renewal pricing, and cancellation policy; visible trust badges/copy near the CTA and price (including in the buy button wording); a compact “How do I cancel?” FAQ that educates on easy cancellation; refund guarantee messaging with a brief, easy refund process; and trust signals such as “Secured via the App Store,” a trial timeline, and a reminder promise. Prior teams report positive conversion effects when this reassurance copy is visible (not hidden) and adjacent to the CTA, and when combined with a strong default to the annual plan.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing contextual trial-state microcopy (“No payment due now” if a trial is available; otherwise “No commitment, cancel anytime”/“Cancel anytime”), alongside explicit subscription terms (trial length, renewal price, cancellation policy), a compact cancellation FAQ, refund guarantee messaging with an easy refund process, and trust signals (“Secured via the App Store,” trial timeline, reminder promise), will increase trial starts/conversions and reduce refund requests because it lowers perceived risk, removes uncertainty at decision time, and meets store compliance expectations.

**Control:** Current paywall as-is, without the proposed contextual trust copy, explicit in-paywall presentation of trial length/renewal price/cancellation policy, visible trust badges near the CTA/price, compact “How do I cancel?” FAQ, refund guarantee messaging with easy refund process, or the additional trust signals (e.g., “Secured via the App Store,” trial timeline, reminder promise).

**Variant:** Update the paywall to: (1) Add a dynamic trust line directly under or adjacent to the primary CTA: show “No payment due now” when a free trial applies; otherwise show “No commitment, cancel anytime”/“Cancel anytime.” (2) Make reassurance copy visible near the CTA and price (and reflected in the buy button wording) and include concise trust badges (e.g., “No payment due now,” “Cancel anytime,” “No commitment”). (3) Clearly list subscription terms within the paywall: trial length, renewal price, and cancellation policy; include a trial timeline and a reminder promise; and add “Secured via the App Store.” (4) Include a compact, expandable FAQ entry (“How do I cancel?”) that briefly explains the simple cancellation process. (5) Add refund guarantee messaging (satisfaction or money-back) with a brief note on the easy refund process.

## Unified branded, multi‑page paywalls with context‑specific copy across app and web

**Description:** Test consolidating paywall presentation across app and web by reinforcing the brand (brand mark, consistent visual identity), reusing the same visual language across soft and hard paywalls while tailoring copy to user context (e.g., pre‑results vs post‑share), and mirroring the in‑app multi‑page paywall on web with the same value narrative, reassurance, and social proof. This matters because brand reinforcement helped credibility and supported long‑form layouts, and consistent branding and flow can improve web conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that applying brand reinforcement (brand mark, consistent visual identity) across paywalls, reusing the same imagery/visual language while tailoring copy to user context (e.g., pre‑results vs post‑share), and mirroring the in‑app multi‑page paywall on web with the same value narrative, reassurance, and social proof will increase perceived credibility, support long‑form layouts, and improve web conversion because brand reinforcement helped credibility and consistent branding/flow can improve web conversion.

**Control:** Current paywalls as implemented today without explicit brand reinforcement via brand mark and consistent visual identity; soft and hard paywalls do not intentionally reuse the same visual language and copy is not tailored to user context; the web paywall does not mirror the in‑app multi‑page flow (value narrative, reassurance, social proof).

**Variant:** Introduce brand reinforcement on all paywalls (add brand mark and apply a consistent visual identity); ensure soft and hard paywalls reuse the same imagery/visual language while tailoring copy to the user’s context (e.g., pre‑results vs post‑share); implement a matching multi‑page paywall on web that mirrors the in‑app flow, including the same value narrative, reassurance elements, and social proof, maintaining consistent branding and flow across surfaces.

---

## Hybrid, remote-configurable paywalls for rapid iteration and native performance

**Description:** Test a hybrid paywall architecture that enables server-side updates for rapid A/B testing while preserving native performance. This approach uses a platform-agnostic (web/third-party) paywall to iterate without app releases—testing core elements like price, discount, headline, and CTA—then promotes winning variants to native for speed, seamless UX, and long-term cost control. This matters to keep experiment velocity high while balancing iteration needs vs. UX performance.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a remote-configurable hybrid stack—using a server-driven, platform-agnostic (web/third-party) paywall to rapidly A/B test price, discount, headline, and CTA without app releases, then implementing winners natively—will increase experiment velocity while maintaining faster, more seamless UX and improving long-term cost control.

**Control:** Single-architecture native paywalls without server-side configuration: changes require app releases; limited ability to A/B test core elements; relies on native implementation for fast load times and seamless feel.

**Variant:** Hybrid paywall stack: leverage a server-driven (web-based/third-party) paywall testing tool to run rapid A/B tests on smaller segments across platforms—modifying price, discount, headline, and CTA without app updates—then implement winning variants natively to retain performance and long-term cost control.

---

## Single-lever, sequenced testing for onboarding, paywall, pricing, messaging, and discounts

**Description:** Test a disciplined sequencing of single-lever experiments to isolate impact and speed iteration. Avoid testing multiple onboarding flows and multiple paywalls together, separate pricing from design, keep messaging and placement/frequency isolated, and run discount/abandonment tests apart from onboarding/paywall tests. This reduces cross‑contamination, improves interpretability, and maintains faster velocity with cleaner data.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that isolating tests to a single lever at a time and sequencing them—(1) run multiple onboarding flows to the same paywall, pick a winner; (2) run price/packaging on a stable control design, then apply the winning pricing to paywall‑design tests (multi‑page, exit drawers, single‑plan views); (3) keep messaging and placement/frequency changes separate; (4) run discount/abandonment tests separately from onboarding/paywall—will produce faster velocity, cleaner data, and confident attribution of lift/loss versus mixing levers (e.g., 3×3 onboarding×paywall combos or changing trial length and hero copy together).

**Control:** Mixed‑lever testing and overlapping experiments: test multiple onboarding flows and multiple paywalls together (e.g., 3×3=9 combos); combine price/packaging changes with paywall‑design variations; change messaging (e.g., hero copy) alongside pricing (e.g., trial length) in the same variant; and run onboarding paywall tests together with discount/abandonment offers.

**Variant:** Single‑lever isolation and sequencing protocol: (a) Onboarding—run multiple onboarding flows to the same paywall, select a winner, then switch to testing paywalls; (b) Pricing vs design—run price/packaging tests on a stable control design; afterward, apply the winning pricing to paywall‑design tests (including multi‑page, exit drawers, single‑plan views) to isolate design impact; (c) Lever discipline—classify each experiment under one lever only (pricing/packaging, paywall design, messaging, or placement/frequency) and avoid mixing changes in any variant (e.g., do not change trial length and hero copy simultaneously); (d) Discounts/abandonment—run separately from onboarding/paywall tests to avoid cross‑contamination, then evaluate the combined funnel effect before picking a winner.

## Coaching Add-on Timing: Pre- vs Post-Trial (7-day Coach Trial)

**Description:** Test whether timing the coaching add-on before vs after the primary free trial affects conversion to coaching premium by running a parallel, cohort experiment on the same plan. One group gets a free 7-day coach trial included during the primary free trial; the other only sees the coaching trial/add-on after the primary subscription is launched.

**Hypothesis:** Offering the coaching add-on before the primary free trial ends by including a free 7-day coach trial will increase conversion to coaching premium compared to offering the coach trial/add-on only after the primary subscription is launched.

**Control:** Same plan without a coach trial during the primary free trial; the coaching trial/add-on is offered only after the primary subscription is launched (i.e., after the free trial ends).

**Variant:** Same plan with a free 7-day coach trial included during the primary free trial; the coaching add-on is offered before the free trial ends.

---

## Real Expiring Countdown vs Evergreen “Limited Time” on Second Offer

**Description:** Test whether a genuine, real-time countdown that actually expires improves urgency and trust versus an evergreen “limited offer” label for a heavily discounted lifetime second offer shown after the first paywall. The variant clarifies persistence across sessions and what happens at zero to avoid distrust from inconsistent or non‑expiring timers.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing an authentic countdown that persists across sessions and truly expires—removing the limited‑time discount and hiding the timer—on the second, heavily discounted lifetime offer will increase perceived urgency and credibility versus an evergreen “limited time” label, because non‑expiring or inconsistent timers create skepticism and distrust while real expiry can encourage repeated engagement for new offers.

**Control:** After the first paywall, show a second, heavily discounted lifetime offer with an evergreen “limited offer/limited time” label. No countdown is shown; the label and discount remain available across sessions and do not expire.

**Variant:** After the first paywall, show the same heavily discounted lifetime offer with a visible, real‑time countdown that persists across sessions. When the timer reaches zero, the timer disappears and the limited‑time discount is removed (offer reverts to the standard/non‑discount state).

## Model breakeven before discounting

**Description:** Estimate how much incremental volume a discount must generate to offset lost revenue from baseline full-price sales and avoid net revenue declines.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that estimating the breakeven incremental volume for a discount and only proceeding when projections meet or exceed that threshold will avoid net revenue declines by offsetting lost full-price revenue.

**Control:** Discounts are applied without estimating the breakeven incremental volume relative to baseline full-price sales.

**Variant:** Before applying a discount, estimate the incremental volume required to offset lost revenue from baseline full-price sales; apply the discount only if projected incremental volume meets or exceeds this breakeven threshold.

## Country-level segmentation to tailor paywall pricing/creative

**Description:** Test whether segmenting paywall performance by country/locale and monitoring yearly vs. monthly plan mix per country can inform market-specific pricing or creative changes that improve conversion and plan mix alignment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that segmenting results by country/locale and leveraging country-level yearly vs. monthly uptake will reveal regional differences and misaligned pricing or framing, and that tailoring pricing or creative by market accordingly will increase conversion and improve plan mix alignment by country.

**Control:** A single global paywall with uniform pricing and creative across countries/locales; results tracked in aggregate without country-level plan mix monitoring.

**Variant:** Segment paywall results by country/locale and monitor yearly vs. monthly uptake per country; when regional differences or misalignments are identified, apply market-specific pricing or creative framing tailored to each market and prioritize those markets for changes.

---

## Category-aligned plan durations

**Description:** Test emphasizing annual plans in categories that skew annual and weekly subscriptions where that is the norm, based on the observation that user plan-length preferences vary by category.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that aligning the emphasized plan duration to category norms (annual where categories skew annual; weekly where weekly is the norm) will be more effective than a non-category-aligned emphasis because user plan-length preferences vary by category.

**Control:** Existing plan-duration emphasis that is not tailored by category.

**Variant:** Category-aligned emphasis: highlight annual plans in categories that skew annual and highlight weekly subscriptions in categories where weekly is the norm.

---

## Introduce a 6‑month plan for seasonal/one‑off use

**Description:** Test offering a mid‑duration plan tailored to users who only need the app for part of the year. This aims to improve upfront cash compared to monthly billing and better align pricing with real usage windows.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering a 6‑month plan at $69.99 will increase upfront cash versus monthly billing and better match seasonal/one‑off usage needs.

**Control:** Current pricing with monthly billing only (no 6‑month option).

**Variant:** Add a 6‑month plan priced at $69.99, offered alongside the existing monthly plan.

---

## Remove last-chance friction screens

**Description:** Test removing a low-value, friction-adding last-chance screen and rely on transaction-abandon flows and exit-offers to recover potential buyers.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the last-chance screen will reduce friction without harming buyer recovery because potential buyers can be recovered via transaction-abandon flows and exit-offers.

**Control:** Current experience includes the last-chance screen; existing transaction-abandon and exit-offer mechanisms remain as is.

**Variant:** Remove the last-chance screen and rely on transaction-abandon flows and exit-offers to recover potential buyers.

---

## Immediate post-cancel recovery offer with holdout to measure lift and cannibalization

**Description:** Test presenting a recovery offer immediately after a canceled purchase/checkout abandonment versus doing nothing, using a holdout design (e.g., 50/50 split) to track downstream conversion and quantify true lift versus any cannibalization of full-price purchases.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a recovery offer immediately after a canceled purchase will increase downstream conversion, and comparing to a no-offer holdout will show the true lift and any cannibalization of full-price purchases.

**Control:** Checkout abandoners/canceled purchases receive no recovery offer after cancellation (holdout). Track downstream conversion and full-price purchases.

**Variant:** Checkout abandoners/canceled purchases are immediately presented with a recovery offer after cancellation. Track downstream conversion and full-price purchases.

---

## Web-to-app checkout sheet vs standard web checkout

**Description:** Compare a native-feeling slide-up purchase sheet on web (backed by your payment processor) to standard web checkout to see if it improves conversion and handoff to app.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a native-feeling slide-up purchase sheet on web (backed by your payment processor) will improve conversion and handoff to app compared to the standard web checkout.

**Control:** Current standard web checkout.

**Variant:** A native-feeling slide-up purchase sheet on web (backed by your payment processor).

---

## Progressively render paywalls on slow connections

**Description:** Test prioritizing rendering of text, pricing, and CTAs before images or rich media to reduce shimmer time and enable quicker interaction on slower networks or devices.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prioritizing the rendering of text, pricing, and CTAs before images or rich media on slow connections will reduce shimmer time and allow users to interact with the paywall more quickly.

**Control:** Current paywall rendering where images and rich media load alongside or before text, pricing, and CTAs, leading to longer shimmer time on slower networks or devices.

**Variant:** Progressive rendering where text, pricing, and CTAs are prioritized to appear and be usable first, with images and rich media deferred until after these elements load, especially on slower networks or devices.

---

## Seasonal Discount Presence vs. No Offer

**Description:** A/B test the presence of a promotional discount against a control with no offer during special occasions. Discount visibility is an element users pay attention to, and in some markets a no-offer experience can outperform discounts. This evaluates the impact on conversion during these occasions.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that during special occasions, showing a visible promotional discount (vs. no discount) will change conversion because users pay attention to discount visibility; however, in some markets, a no-offer experience may outperform a discount.

**Control:** During the special occasion, no promotional offer/discount is shown (no offer).

**Variant:** During the special occasion, a promotional discount is shown (discount present/visible).

---

## Copy-only paywall test: headline and CTA variants by locale and flow stage

**Description:** Hold layout and pricing constant while iterating headline, body, and CTA text to identify higher-converting copy without design confounds. This test spans multi-page paywalls and onboarding flows, evaluates locale-specific phrasing, aligns headlines with marketing creative, and measures both initial conversion and trial-to-pay.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that clarifying and aligning headline and CTA copy—by locale, flow stage, and offer format—will increase initial conversion and improve trial-to-pay because users focus heavily on these elements, small wording shifts materially impact behavior, creative-aligned headlines maintain narrative continuity, simplifying body text improves readability, and less committal early CTAs reduce confusion about initiating a charge.

**Control:** Current paywall/onboarding copy unchanged: existing headlines and body text, current default CTAs (e.g., “Try it free”/“Try for $0” where used), current treatment on the first screen of multi-page flows, and no deliberate ad-to-headline alignment. Layout and pricing remain as-is. Baseline metrics captured for initial conversion and trial-to-pay.

**Variant:** Copy-only changes while keeping layout and pricing constant:
- CTA variants by locale: compare “Try it free” vs “Start your free week” vs “Start free trial” vs more generic CTAs; include “Try for $0.00”. Local languages may perform differently.
- Discount-offer CTA: test “Redeem X days for $Y” versus a standard discount CTA.
- Multi-page paywalls: compare “Start your free week” vs “Try 7 days free” vs “Unlock free for 7 days”; on the first page, replace “Try for $0” with “Learn more” to reduce confusion.
- Onboarding-style flows: test “Start” vs “Continue” vs value-led CTAs (including reductions of frictional wording like “Continue for free”).
- Additional CTA labels: include “Claim offer”, “Continue”, and “Subscribe”.
- Headline tests: value-framing vs benefit-led vs brand statements; compare creative-aligned headlines that mirror the ad message vs generic headers.
- Body copy: where long, simplify into concise bullet points with checkmarks to improve readability.
- Measurement: track initial conversion and trial-to-pay across variants and locales.

## Reinforce Free Trial Across Paywall (Banner, Feature Bullet, and Plan-Card Callouts)

**Description:** Test whether making the free trial highly prominent across the paywall—via a larger “Try for free” banner, a visually highlighted “Free for 7 days” feature bullet, explicit trial length and savings on applicable plan cards, and reinforcement in the headline, plan labels, and CTA—improves salience and helps users connect the full value with the free trial period.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prominently reinforcing the free trial across the headline, plan labels, CTA, features list, and plan cards—plus adding a rectangular “Try for free” banner larger than the purchase button—will improve salience and help users connect the full value with the free trial period because the trial length and percentage/dollar savings are made visibly explicit and the offer is visually highlighted in multiple places.

**Control:** Existing paywall where the free trial (if present) appears only in small subtext and is not reinforced across the headline, plan labels, or CTA; no prominent rectangular/banner “Try for free” element larger than the purchase button; no visually highlighted “Free for 7 days” feature bullet; and plan cards do not explicitly display trial length or percentage/dollar savings.

**Variant:** - Add a rectangular/banner “Try for free” element that is larger and more visually prominent than the purchase button.
- Add “Free for 7 days” as a benefit in the features area (e.g., final bullet) with a distinct background or highlight.
- Reinforce the free trial across the headline, plan labels, and CTA—not only in small subtext.
- On each plan that includes a trial, make trial length and percentage/dollar savings visibly explicit on the plan card; avoid showing trial text on plans with no trial.

## Power‑User Premium Tier with SLA Support, Off‑App Benefits, and Usage‑Aligned Upsells

**Description:** Test introducing a higher‑priced premium tier for heavy/power users, packaged around what they value most and differentiated with premium benefits (priority support with SLAs, exclusive content, additional IAP‑based value) and off‑app benefits (e.g., education access, expert consults, equipment credit). Anchor pricing with a high‑priced tier and drive mix upmarket by offering trials only on the target tier. Upsells are aligned to usage patterns to boost LTV, ARPU, upgrades, and satisfaction, accepting lower conversion for higher ARPU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a higher‑priced, white‑glove premium tier for power users—packaged around their most‑valued features and differentiated with faster, guaranteed support (B2B‑style SLA), exclusive content, additional IAP‑based value, and off‑app benefits—anchored by a high‑priced tier and with trials only on the target tier—will increase upgrades among power users and boost ARPU/LTV and satisfaction in B2C, even with lower conversion, because the offering maps to heavy‑user needs and perceived premium value.

**Control:** Existing offering without the proposed changes (no dedicated power‑user premium tier, no SLA‑backed priority support, no off‑app benefits, no usage‑aligned upsell prompts, and no high‑priced anchor or trial limited to a specific tier).

**Variant:** Identify heavy/power users and introduce a higher‑priced premium tier designed for a white‑glove experience. Package the tier around the features power users value most; test multiple premium bundle configurations to see which drives the most upgrades. Differentiate the highest tier with faster, guaranteed support response times (B2B‑style SLA). Include premium benefits such as priority support, exclusive content, and additional IAP‑based value, plus off‑app benefits (e.g., education access, expert consults, equipment credit). Anchor pricing with a high‑priced tier and offer trials only on the target premium tier. Align upsell prompts to usage patterns.

## Contextual Paywall Strategy: Multi-page Onboarding Explainer vs Single-page App-Launch

**Description:** Test reserving multi-page paywall flows for onboarding (first view) while using a single-page design for app-launch contexts to reduce friction for returning users. The onboarding flow acts like a mini-onboarding (value, features, social proof, plan selection) that tells the value story before the purchase step; the app-launch flow stays single-page (e.g., timeline layout).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using a multi-page explainer flow during onboarding and a single-page design at app launch will increase purchase conversion in onboarding, lower early cancellations, and reduce friction for returning users because the explainer sequence focuses on one message per screen, uses visuals/video and social proof to communicate value before plan selection, and the single-page app-launch layout minimizes steps.

**Control:** Single-page paywall shown in both onboarding and app-launch contexts (paywall alone), with no multi-page explainer, carousel, or timeline-style elements.

**Variant:** Contextual paywalls by user context. Onboarding (first-view-only): a 2–4 step multi-page explainer within the paywall—1) clear value prop and how the app works, 2) visual feature previews (2–3 slide carousel with visuals/video highlighting key modes/features), 3) purchase step (plan selection) with social proof on the final decision page and optional reminders (e.g., trial terms). Flow details: hide the close button until the last page; use a primary CTA like “Start”; leverage a navigation element to string screens, keep a consistent footer, control transitions, and hide the back button when appropriate. App-launch (outside onboarding/returning users): a single-page paywall (e.g., timeline layout); avoid multi-page outside onboarding to reduce friction.

---

## Gated, Post‑Onboarding App‑Open Paywalls With Frequency Caps (Free Users Only)

**Description:** Test gating app‑open paywalls behind onboarding completion and prior paywall exposure, excluding first sessions, and enforcing frequency caps (e.g., days since last paywall ≥ 1; once per day; some teams use once every 3 days). This aims to avoid first‑run conflicts and back‑to‑back exposures, reduce perceived spam, fatigue, complaints, and uninstalls, and still reach optimal paywall impressions per user. Related patterns also gate periodic paywalls (e.g., after several category switches) behind a total paywall views threshold.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a paywall at app open only to free users after onboarding, excluding the first session, and only after at least one prior paywall view—while capping frequency (≥1 day since last paywall and at most once per day)—will reduce fatigue, complaints, uninstalls, and perceived spam while maintaining optimal paywall impressions per user because it prevents first‑run conflicts and back‑to‑back exposures.

**Control:** Current app‑open paywall behavior as implemented today (no additional gating by onboarding completion or prior paywall views, and without the new frequency caps described here).

**Variant:** At app open, show a paywall only if all conditions are met: (1) user is free; (2) onboarding completed; (3) not the first app open (is first app open = false); (4) total paywall views ≥ 1 before eligibility (a stricter option used elsewhere is > 1). Apply frequency guards: require days since last paywall ≥ 1 and limit app‑open paywalls to once per day. For periodic paywalls (e.g., after several category switches), apply the same total paywall views threshold before showing them.

---

## Bold, simple headline and clear discount UI on seasonal paywalls

**Description:** For time-bound promotions, test whether keeping copy punchy, showing the original vs. discounted price (e.g., strike-through), and highlighting that the discount applies to the first year only improves performance.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, for time-bound promotions, using a bold, simple headline and clear discount UI that shows the original vs. discounted price (e.g., strike-through) and clarifies that the discount applies to the first year only will outperform the current seasonal paywall approach.

**Control:** Current seasonal paywall for time-bound promotions as implemented today, without enforcing a bold, simple headline, without explicitly showing original vs. discounted price, and without explicitly noting that the discount applies to the first year only.

**Variant:** Seasonal paywall uses a bold, simple headline and punchy copy; displays original vs. discounted price with a strike-through treatment; and explicitly highlights that the discount applies to the first year only.

---

## Clarify "Unlock access" vs "Unlimited" messaging on a gated product

**Description:** If the product is gated (not truly unlimited), test replacing "Unlimited" with "Unlock access" and explicitly listing what becomes available to reduce confusion and checkout abandonment.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, for a gated product, replacing "Unlimited" with "Unlock access" and explicitly listing what becomes available will reduce confusion and checkout abandonment.

**Control:** Current messaging uses "Unlimited" to describe access and does not explicitly list what becomes available.

**Variant:** Replace "Unlimited" with "Unlock access" and explicitly list what becomes available.

---

## Present the paywall as a “getting started” screen

**Description:** Test reframing the paywall as the start of play rather than a purchase step. The screen emphasizes beginning play with an “Unlimited play” headline, a single prominent “Start” CTA, and light value bullets supported by a countdown.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting the paywall as a “getting started” screen with an “Unlimited play” headline, a single “Start” CTA, a countdown, and light value bullets will encourage more users to proceed because it frames the experience as beginning play rather than purchasing.

**Control:** Existing paywall presentation that is not framed as beginning play (current baseline experience).

**Variant:** Reframe the paywall as a “getting started” screen: use an “Unlimited play” headline, include a single prominent “Start” CTA, and support with a countdown and light value bullets.

---

## Dynamic “Upgrade for $Y more” using current paid price attribute

**Description:** Test passing each user’s current paid price (as a numeric user parameter) to power dynamic incremental upgrade cost messaging (“Upgrade for $Y more”) and to filter upgrade prompts to eligible users only in the in‑app upgrade flow.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that passing the user’s current paid price as a numeric user parameter will enable accurate “Upgrade for $Y more” messaging and allow upgrade prompts to be shown only to eligible users.

**Control:** In‑app upgrades without passing the user’s current paid price; upgrade messaging does not display the incremental cost (“Upgrade for $Y more”), and audience eligibility is not determined using this parameter.

**Variant:** Pass the user’s current paid price as a numeric user parameter; dynamically display the incremental cost (“Upgrade for $Y more”) in upgrade messaging and filter upgrade prompts to eligible users only.

---

## Paywall plan layout and selector UX test

**Description:** Test how plan stack direction (vertical vs horizontal) on the same paywall, selector style (segmented controls vs discrete buttons), and plan comparison UX (inline vs expandable drawer) affect outcomes. Keep other elements constant to isolate each effect. Track share of the target high‑LTV plan, overall conversion, and revenue per user.

**Hypothesis:** Changing stack direction, selector style, and plan comparison UX will materially impact the share of the target high‑LTV plan, overall conversion, and revenue per user, because these choices alter how options are presented on the same paywall.

**Control:** Current paywall implementation: existing stack direction, current selector style, and current plan comparison UX, with all other elements unchanged.

**Variant:** Run A/B variants against the control, each isolating one factor: 1) Alternate stack direction (vertical vs horizontal) on the same paywall, holding selector style and comparison UX constant. 2) Alternate selector style (segmented controls vs discrete buttons), holding stack direction and comparison UX constant. 3) Alternate plan comparison UX (inline vs expandable drawer), holding stack direction and selector style constant. Measure share of the target high‑LTV plan, overall conversion, and revenue per user for each comparison.

---

## Push permission prompt: immediate post-first success (value-based) vs generic timing

**Description:** Test asking for push permissions immediately after the user completes a rewarding core action (first success) with value-tied copy that explicitly explains the benefit, versus a generic prompt shown earlier or later. This aims to improve push opt-in.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that asking for push permissions immediately after the user's first rewarding core action, with value-based copy explicitly explaining the benefit, will improve opt-in compared to a generic-timed prompt.

**Control:** Generic push permission prompt shown earlier or later (not tied to a success moment), using generic copy without explicit benefit explanation.

**Variant:** Push permission prompt shown immediately after the user's first successful/rewarding core action, with copy that explicitly explains the benefit (value-tied).

---

## Discount Type and Timing: Exit/Win‑Back vs Time‑Since‑Install

**Description:** Test exit discounts and win‑backs versus time‑since‑install discounts; performance varies by audience and app.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that the type and timing of discounts (exit/win‑backs vs time‑since‑install) will yield different performance across audiences and apps, because performance varies by audience and app.

**Control:** Users receive time‑since‑install discounts.

**Variant:** Users receive exit discounts and win‑backs.

---

## Feature matrix with checkmarks, discount badge, and monthly‑equivalent pricing on multi‑tier plans

**Description:** Test adding a clear feature‑comparison table (with check‑marks highlighting unique benefits) under each plan, combined with a small, visible discount badge and monthly‑equivalent pricing for annual plans. This aims to improve perceived value, reduce sticker shock, clarify the value gap between two concurrent tiers, and assist user self‑selection to increase conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a clear feature‑comparison matrix with check‑marks under each plan, plus a small, visible discount badge and monthly‑equivalent pricing for annual plans, will improve perceived value, reduce sticker shock, assist self‑selection between tiers, and increase conversion because the table clarifies the value gap and the pricing presentation is easier to compare.

**Control:** Current multi‑tier paywall without a feature‑comparison table, no discount badge, and annual plans shown without monthly‑equivalent pricing.

**Variant:** Multi‑tier paywall that includes: (1) a clear feature‑comparison matrix under each plan highlighting unique benefits with check‑marks; (2) a small, visible discount badge; and (3) monthly‑equivalent pricing displayed for annual plans.

---

## Red Strikethrough Anchoring on Annualized Shorter‑Duration Prices vs Simple Yearly

**Description:** Test whether showing the annualized price of shorter‑duration plans (e.g., monthly × 12 or weekly annualized) with a red strikethrough next to the yearly price increases perceived savings, compared to showing only the simple yearly price with no strikethrough. This quantifies anchoring effects on yearly selection.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting the higher annualized price of a shorter‑duration plan (e.g., monthly × 12) crossed out in red will increase yearly plan selection because the red strikethrough emphasizes savings and anchors the yearly price.

**Control:** Show only the simple yearly price with no annualized monthly/weekly comparison and no strikethrough.

**Variant:** Show the yearly price alongside the annualized price of the shorter‑duration plan (e.g., monthly × 12 or weekly annualized) with a red strikethrough on the higher annualized price to signal savings.

---

## Invite-to-Unlock (Contact Picker/SMS): Grant on Send vs Grant on Signup

**Description:** Test a non-pay path to unlock by inviting N friends via contact picker and SMS. Evaluate whether granting access upon sending invites or after recipient sign-ups better supports virality-focused use cases.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, where virality is strategic, granting access upon sending invites to N contacts will better support virality than granting access only after recipient sign-ups, because the unlock is tied directly to the invite action via contact picker/SMS.

**Control:** Invite-to-unlock flow via contact picker and SMS; access is granted only after N invited recipients sign up.

**Variant:** Invite-to-unlock flow via contact picker and SMS; access is granted immediately upon sending invites to N contacts.

---

## English‑first paywall testing with staged localization and market‑by‑market rollout

**Description:** Test whether limiting early paywall experiments to a primary locale/language (often English) in top monetizing markets, using device language targeting and separate “English” vs “Rest of World” audiences, accelerates iteration without hurting performance. After a clear winner emerges, localize the winning design/pricing via string catalogs/auto‑translation and roll out country‑by‑country, keeping a fallback English experience and accounting for country‑level differences.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running initial paywall tests in one language/locale (English) focused on top markets, with audiences targeted by device language code (not just IP) and segmented into “English” vs “Rest of World,” will speed iteration and yield a higher‑performing localized paywall when rolled out market‑by‑market. This is because it reduces localization overhead up front and allows focused learning; once a winner is found, localizing via strings upload/download or auto‑translation and expanding by country will better accommodate differences across countries that may require different paywalls.

**Control:** Localize the control paywall for all markets upfront. Run the paywall A/B test in 1–2 top locales first, with both control and test variants fully localized for those locales from the start. When a winner emerges, localize that variant and roll it out market‑by‑market.

**Variant:** Build separate “English” and “Rest of World” audiences using device language code (preferred) or IP country. Start with English‑only experiments in top monetizing markets (e.g., US/CA/UK/AU) and/or limit to a few core languages (top 4–6) to move fast. Keep a fallback English experience for all other users during the test. Delay localization until a design winner is found, then localize the winning design and pricing via string catalogs/strings upload‑download or auto‑translation and expand country‑by‑country, noting that some countries may need different paywalls.

---

## Dedicated selected_plan state for plan selection logic

**Description:** Test using a dedicated selected_plan state (e.g., monthly/yearly) to govern UI highlight, price display, and purchase routing—decoupled from product indices—to prevent misalignment caused by sale logic or UI conditions.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that driving UI highlight, price display, and purchase routing from a dedicated selected_plan state (monthly/yearly) will keep these elements aligned with user choice under varying sale logic and UI conditions, because it removes reliance on product indices or default selection.

**Control:** Current behavior where UI highlight, price display, and purchase routing rely on product index or default selection.

**Variant:** Introduce a dedicated selected_plan state (monthly/yearly) that exclusively governs UI highlight, price display, and purchase routing, independent of product index, particularly when sale logic or UI conditions change.

---

## Above-the-fold paywall social proof (awards/ratings/logos/bandwagon) vs none

**Description:** Test adding a compact, prominent social proof module directly on the paywall to build credibility and reduce purchase anxiety without overwhelming the page. The module combines lightweight proof (awards/press/rating badges in a swipeable gallery, “as seen in” media logos, trusted partner/training-facility/university/institution badges, star rating + total ratings/review count, and a concise bandwagon line like “Join X+ million users”), placed near the primary CTA and kept uncluttered and non-scrolling so core value and CTA remain above the fold. Prior teams saw small positive effects when used judiciously; we will measure uplift in trust and conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding light, concise social proof (awards/press/ratings, review count, partner/media/institution logos, and bandwagon copy) prominently above the fold near the CTA—using a swipeable awards carousel to save space—will increase perceived trust and purchase conversion and reduce purchase anxiety versus a paywall without social proof, provided it does not crowd out core content or push the CTA below the fold.

**Control:** Current paywall with no social proof around the CTA (no awards/press mentions, ratings/review count, partner/media/institution logos, or bandwagon statement).

**Variant:** Paywall includes a compact social proof section placed above the fold and adjacent to the primary CTA that: (1) displays awards/recognition badges in a swipeable carousel; (2) shows “as seen in” media logos and recognizable partner/training-facility/university or institutional badges; (3) surfaces a star rating and total ratings/review count (optionally via a lightweight reviews carousel with one highlighted testimonial); and (4) adds a concise bandwagon statement such as “Join X+ million users.” The design is clean, subtle, and non-scrolling at the page level, and must not push core content or the primary CTA below the fold.

---

## Remove header/navigation and secondary banners on sale landing pages

**Description:** Test stripping non-essential header/navigation links and suppressing secondary banners on promo/sale landing pages during sale periods to reduce distractions, keep focus on the offer and checkout, and ensure the primary sale banner and paywall path stand out.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing non-essential header/navigation and suppressing secondary banners on sale landing pages during sale periods will reduce distractions so the primary sale banner, paywall path, and checkout receive more attention and do not compete for attention.

**Control:** Sale landing pages with the standard site header/navigation intact and secondary banners visible; the primary sale banner and paywall path may compete with other elements for attention.

**Variant:** Promo/sale landing pages where non-essential header/navigation links are removed and secondary banners are removed or suppressed so the primary sale banner and paywall path stand out and focus remains on the offer and checkout.

---

## Post-error pop-up nudge for payment/paywall errors (A/B test)

**Description:** Show a pop-up nudge immediately after a payment or paywall error to recover conversions to paid. For high-ARR apps (>$5–10M ARR), a meaningful share of users encounter these errors; identifying and nudging this recoverable cohort is a high-ROI revenue opportunity. Test impact via an A/B experiment on users who encounter an error.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a pop-up nudge immediately after a payment or paywall error will yield around 10% conversion to paid relative to no nudge, because error-impacted users are a recoverable cohort and, at scale, this drives additional revenue for high-ARR apps.

**Control:** Users who encounter a payment or paywall error see no pop-up nudge after the error.

**Variant:** Immediately after a payment or paywall error, show a pop-up that nudges users to continue to paid.

---

## Granular Onboarding Instrumentation to Optimize Paywall Timing and UI Flow

**Description:** Test whether adding detailed onboarding instrumentation and using it to target drop‑offs can reduce funnel abandonment. This includes tracking field‑level advances, onboarding slide/page views, plan selection events, and key step completions, then using these signals to test paywall placement (earlier/later), avoid unnecessary pre‑paywall interstitials, apply UI micro‑tweaks (e.g., auto‑advance), and scaffold multi‑step paywall funnels.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that instrumenting onboarding at the field, slide/page, step, and plan‑selection levels (including events like each form field advance, 'selected_weekly', 'selected_annual', account created, quiz completed) and using these data to (a) identify and fix stall points with UI tweaks such as auto‑advance, (b) place the paywall earlier or later while avoiding unnecessary interstitials before it unless they improve intent, and (c) scaffold multi‑step paywall funnel variations will reduce onboarding and paywall drop‑off because we can find the biggest issues and iterate surgically.

**Control:** Current onboarding flow, plan selection, and paywall placement as is, with no additional field‑level, onboarding slide/page view, onboarding step, or plan‑selection event instrumentation, and no new UI tweaks or paywall sequence changes.

**Variant:** Add instrumentation to send events for: each form field advance (field‑level completion), each onboarding slide/page view, key onboarding steps (e.g., account created, quiz completed), and plan selections ('selected_weekly', 'selected_annual'). Build funnels from these events to find the biggest drop‑offs and iterate surgically. Based on identified stalls, apply UI tweaks such as auto‑advance to the next field where users stall. Test paywall placement earlier and later in the onboarding flow and avoid unnecessary interstitials before the paywall unless they improve intent. Use the recorded onboarding step events to scaffold multi‑step paywall funnel variations.

---

## Device-specific small-screen paywall with conditional layout and scaling rules

**Description:** Test creating dedicated paywall variants for small devices (e.g., compact phones) and targeting them with rules, combined with conditional layout tweaks and viewport-based scaling. The goal is to prevent layout crowding, keep critical content and CTAs above the fold, maximize CTA visibility, and reduce scroll dependency.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that dedicated small-screen paywall variants targeted via device rules, with conditional tweaks (e.g., tighter paddings, smaller headers) and viewport thresholds that reduce font sizes or spacing below a height, will keep critical content and CTAs above the fold, maximize CTA visibility, reduce scroll dependency, and prevent layout crowding because designs optimized for compact phones ensure everyone on these devices sees an optimized design.

**Control:** The current paywall layout without device-specific variants, small-screen conditional layout tweaks, or viewport-threshold scaling.

**Variant:** Dedicated paywall variants for small devices (e.g., compact phones) targeted via device rules. Apply conditional layout tweaks (e.g., tighter paddings, smaller headers) and small-screen scaling rules using viewport thresholds (e.g., reduce font sizes or spacing below a height) to keep critical content and CTAs above the fold, maximize CTA visibility, reduce scroll dependency, and prevent layout crowding.

---

## Legacy-user specific multi-page paywall with loyalty discount

**Description:** Test a legacy-user–targeted, multi-page paywall that first announces “What’s new,” then “Unlock the new features,” and finally presents a limited-time loyalty discount (e.g., 50% off for the first year) to convert long-time users on new value while avoiding alienation.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing flagged legacy users a multi-page paywall sequence (“What’s new” → “Unlock the new features” → limited-time loyalty discount, e.g., 50% off for first year) will increase conversions among long-time users and reduce alienation because it frames the change around new value and rewards loyalty.

**Control:** Current paywall experience shown to legacy users (status quo).

**Variant:** Flag legacy users and show a three-step paywall: 1) “What’s new,” 2) “Unlock the new features,” 3) a limited-time loyalty discount (e.g., 50% off for the first year).

## Gate web checkout by Apple Pay availability

**Description:** Route only users with Apple Pay enabled to web checkout to reduce friction; others default to IAP. Implement by passing a user attribute and targeting it in campaign rules.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that gating web checkout to Apple Pay-enabled users and defaulting others to IAP will reduce friction compared to current routing, because users with Apple Pay can complete web checkout more easily.

**Control:** Current routing without gating by Apple Pay availability (users follow the existing checkout path regardless of Apple Pay status).

**Variant:** If a user has Apple Pay enabled, route them to web checkout; if not, default them to IAP. Pass a user attribute indicating Apple Pay availability and use it to target routing in campaign rules.

## Value‑Prop Presentation Formats on Paywall/First Screen: Visual Carousel/UI Video vs Text List/Table

**Description:** This experiment compares value‑proposition presentation formats and creative types on the paywall and first screen to determine which best improves scannability, perceived value, and conversion. It covers layout formats (horizontal benefits carousel vs scannable list vs static comparison table) and creative types (short UI video, static UI screenshots, simple illustrations, UGC‑style, lifestyle video/imagery), as well as leading the flow with a short video, a feature list/slide deck/bullets, or a personalized headline. Treatments emphasize showing how the product works and improving scannability: real UI screenshots or short video backgrounds, larger typography, auto‑scroll (~4s), an animated benefit‑cycling hero, and enhanced list formatting (iconography, colorized titles, spacing). Copy remains constant across layouts. Apply to feature paywalls (e.g., likes received) and record click‑through, completion, and conversion. Effects may be modest overall but can vary by audience and vertical.

**Hypothesis:** We believe a visual‑first presentation—using a benefits carousel that mixes real UI screenshots or short UI video, an animated benefit‑cycling hero, larger typography with ~4s auto‑scroll, and surfacing the top 3–4 benefits in a concise, scannable list—will increase click‑through, completion, and conversion versus static tables or dense text‑only lists because clearer, more visual formats improve scannability, elevate perceived value, and better demonstrate how the product works. Performance is expected to vary by audience segment/vertical, with formats that clearly show the product UI performing best when leading the flow.

**Control:** Current text‑first paywall/feature paywall: static comparison table or dense, plain text‑only list of benefits with a static hero image; standard typography; no auto‑scroll or motion; no screenshots/video; no iconography, colorized titles, or spacing enhancements; no personalized headline.

**Variant:** Visual‑first treatment: replace tables/lists with a horizontal benefits carousel that mixes screenshots with benefits and/or short UI video backgrounds; add an animated, benefit‑cycling hero; use larger typography and auto‑scroll (~4s) to improve scannability; surface the top 3–4 benefits in a concise list (with iconography, colorized titles, and spacing) instead of a long, swipe‑only carousel; keep copy the same across layouts. On applicable screens (including feature paywalls like likes received), compare leading creative as short UI video vs feature list/slide deck/bullets vs personalized headline. Test creative types across the hero/carousel (UI video, static UI screenshots, simple illustrations, UGC‑style, lifestyle) while prioritizing content that clearly shows how the product works. Record click‑through and completion rates alongside conversion.

## Countdown urgency: duration, persistence, reversibility, and per‑user windows

**Description:** Test time-limited countdowns to create urgency, including short unlock timers and per‑user limited-time windows. Compare timer durations (10 vs 15 vs 30 minutes), whether timers persist across sessions, and a reversible countdown. Also test a per‑user visible countdown set to 30 days from first exposure. Measure conversion and user complaints/sentiment, and ensure messaging remains compliant and non‑deceptive.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that introducing visible, time‑limited countdowns (short unlock timers and per‑user 30‑day windows) will increase conversion because urgency prompts action, and that timer duration (10/15/30 minutes), persistence across sessions, and a reversible countdown will influence the magnitude of lift without increasing user complaints when messaging is compliant and non‑deceptive.

**Control:** No countdown timers or per‑user time‑bound offers are shown; users see the current experience without urgency elements and with standard messaging.

**Variant:** Introduce urgency elements: - Show a time‑limited countdown to unlock (e.g., 15 minutes), testing durations of 10, 15, and 30 minutes. - Test whether the countdown persists across sessions versus not persisting. - Include a reversible countdown option. - Add a per‑user time‑bound offer with a visible countdown set to 30 days from first exposure. Track conversion and user complaints/sentiment, and ensure all messaging is compliant and non‑deceptive.

## Auto-advancing visual benefits carousel on paywall (animated hero)

**Description:** Replace dense copy/bullet lists on the paywall hero with a horizontal, animated carousel that cycles through the top ~5 benefits/features paired with real UI screenshots and/or short looping clips or subtle device mockups. The carousel auto-advances every 2–3 seconds so users see multiple value propositions without swiping. This approach has repeatedly outperformed text lists, improves comprehension for users who don’t read or do math, and has proven effective in feature-gated contexts (also a high-potential variant for onboarding). Monitor distraction and conversion impact by placement, and plan to retest if it underperforms as the product evolves.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that an auto-advancing animated hero/carousel that cycles through the top ~5 benefits, paired with real UI screenshots or short looping clips, will increase comprehension and conversion on the paywall versus static copy/manual interaction because it communicates value succinctly, exposes multiple value propositions without user effort, and visual benefit communication has outperformed text lists in prior contexts (including feature-gated scenarios).

**Control:** Current paywall with static hero and dense copy and/or feature bullet lists. If any carousel exists, it requires manual swipe and does not auto-advance; visuals are static and not paired with short videos/device mockups.

**Variant:** A horizontal, animated hero/carousel on the paywall that mixes product screenshots with benefit statements (and optionally short, looping videos or subtle device mockups). It auto-advances every 2–3 seconds, is limited to the top ~5 benefits/features tied to premium value, and replaces dense copy/bullet lists. Track distraction and conversion impact by placement.

## Minimal single-screen vs information-dense long-form paywall (locale-sensitive)

**Description:** A/B test a clean, minimal single-screen paywall against a scrollable, information-dense long-form page to isolate design impact on conversion and plan mix. Use identical pricing across variants. Run in locales receptive to more detail (especially Japan, Korea, Taiwan). The long-form can double as an in-app landing page and reduces reliance on engineering to ship. Results will help select a design control for subsequent price tests. Note: a multi-page flow is another candidate design to evaluate in a separate test.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a text-heavy, long-form paywall with decision UI/hero CTA at the top and detailed content below the fold (feature comparison tables, charts, benefit blocks, comparisons, FAQs, testimonials, dense social proof) will increase conversion and influence plan mix in detail-receptive locales (e.g., Japan, Korea, Taiwan) versus a minimal paywall, because these markets respond better to detailed explanations and social proof. Keeping pricing constant will isolate design effects.

**Control:** Clean, single-screen paywall: minimal layout focused on headline, price and discount, a few bullets, and a strong primary CTA (baseline).

**Variant:** Information-dense long-form scrollable paywall/in-app landing page: decision UI and hero CTA at the top; below the fold include feature comparison table, charts, benefit blocks, comparisons, FAQs, testimonials, and dense social proof. Localize with more text-dense copy for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan (and other detail-receptive locales). Use the same pricing as control to isolate design impact.

## Server-to-server revenue tracking and experiment metadata for accurate per-paywall ARPU and LTV

**Description:** Test implementing revenue instrumentation across paywall and subscription events—using the paywall platform’s revenue token and forwarding App Store/Play server notifications and backend billing events—enriched with experiment and variant IDs. This enables proceeds per user, plan-level splits, trial-to-paid, refunds, cancellations, product switching, and renewals to be analyzed at the paywall and product level by variant, unlocking per-paywall ARPU and valid test readouts that reflect actual cash impact and long tail renewals by audience.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding the paywall platform’s revenue token in the purchase backend and forwarding paywall_open and transaction_complete events with experiment and variant IDs, plus App Store/Play server notifications and backend billing events (trials, starts, renewals, refunds, cancellations, proceeds, product switching), to our analytics/paywall/experimentation platforms will unlock per-paywall ARPU (including proceeds per user and plan-level splits) and enable accurate per-variant proceeds, trial conversion, LTV/retention, and test readouts that reflect actual cash impact and long tail renewals by audience.

**Control:** No paywall platform revenue token in the purchase backend. paywall_open and transaction_complete events are not enriched with experiment/variant IDs. App Store/Play Billing server notifications and backend billing/revenue events are not forwarded to analytics, the paywall platform, or the experimentation platform. Accurate per-variant proceeds, trial conversion, refunds, cancellations, product switching, retention, and plan-level splits at the paywall/product level are not available in one place.

**Variant:** Implement server-to-server revenue instrumentation and experiment metadata: (1) Add the paywall platform’s revenue token in the purchase backend to see proceeds per user, plan-level split, and trial-to-paid in one place. (2) Send paywall_open and transaction_complete events with experiment and variant IDs to the analytics tool. (3) Forward billing events (trials, starts, renewals) from the subscription backend for LTV analysis by variant. (4) Pipe App Store/Play Billing server notifications to analytics and/or the data warehouse to enable accurate proceeds, trial conversion, refunds, and product switching analysis at the paywall and product level. (5) Forward revenue events (including refunds, cancellations, and proceeds) to the paywall platform so test readouts reflect actual cash impact and long tail renewals by audience. (6) Forward App Store/Play server notifications (or backend events) to the experimentation platform so proceeds and retention analytics are accurate.

## App-open interstitial announcement vs. silent paywall update for new benefits

**Description:** Test whether announcing a major new benefit (e.g., a protection guarantee) via a multi-step app-open interstitial performs better than silently updating paywalls. The interstitial shows information-only content to existing subscribers and an upgrade CTA to non-subscribers. Measure upgrades and engagement.

**Hypothesis:** Announcing a major new benefit via a multi-step app-open interstitial will increase upgrades and engagement compared to silently updating paywalls.

**Control:** Silent rollout: update paywalls with the new benefit but do not present an app-open interstitial.

**Variant:** App-open interstitial announcement: on app open, present a multi-step interstitial announcing the new benefit; show information-only content to existing subscribers and an upgrade CTA to non-subscribers.

---

## Post‑Trial Day‑30 Triggered One‑Month Discount Offer

**Description:** Test showing a discounted 1‑month pass on the paywall immediately after the standard 30‑day paid trial ends to entice users back into a paid plan.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that firing a day‑30 paid‑trial checkpoint and displaying a discounted 1‑month pass (discount coupon for the first month) after the trial expires will increase conversions into a paid plan because a post‑trial discount can entice users back into a paid plan.

**Control:** Current paywall flow without a post‑trial discounted 1‑month pass and without a day‑30 paid‑trial checkpoint trigger.

**Variant:** At the 30‑day paid‑trial checkpoint (when the trial expires), fire an event that causes the paywall to display a discount coupon for the first month—a discounted 1‑month pass—as a post‑trial offer to entice users back into a paid plan.

---

## Sequence paywall conversion before pricing to maximize ROI and preserve price learnings

**Description:** Test whether prioritizing conversion-focused paywall design/packaging changes before any pricing tests yields better returns at current (sub-scale) revenue and ensures price experiments reflect true price sensitivity. This matters because price tests tend to deliver incremental gains that are only worth the effort at higher revenue scale, and changing packaging mid-price test can invalidate price learnings.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that optimizing paywall clarity and plan packaging (conversion) before touching pricing will produce better ROI at lower scale and that price experiments are only worth running at meaningful revenue scale (e.g., multi‑million ARR). Stabilizing packaging first will prevent invalidating price learnings and isolate true price sensitivity.

**Control:** Run price experiments now, at current (sub-scale) revenue, before optimizing paywall clarity/design and packaging, with a risk that packaging changes during the price tests confound and invalidate price learnings.

**Variant:** Allocate experimentation effort first to improving paywall clarity and refining/stabilizing plan packaging to raise conversion; only after these elements are optimized and revenue has reached meaningful scale, run price tests to validate true price sensitivity.

---

## Goal‑Gradient Progress Visuals vs Static Progress on Paywall and Challenge Screens

**Description:** Test whether goal‑gradient progress visuals—such as a progress bar/filling container toward daily or session goals, a 100‑day challenge visual with dynamic calendar/streak/countdown marking today and a target completion date, and a "You're X days away from the first paid feature" message—placed prominently (e.g., at the top of the paywall) increase motivation, completion, engagement, and downstream conversion compared to a static progress counter or static interface. Measure paywall click‑through and engagement/monetization impact.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding goal‑gradient progress visuals (progress bar/filling container for daily/session progress, dynamic calendar/streak/countdown for a 100‑day challenge, and a "You're X days away from the first paid feature" message at the top of the paywall) will increase paywall click‑through, engagement, and willingness to pay because users feel closer to the finish line, perceive tangible progress, and experience urgency and commitment cues.

**Control:** Static progress presentation: a static progress counter or static interface without goal‑gradient elements (no progress bar/filling container, no dynamic calendar/streak/countdown, no "You're X days away from the first paid feature" message, and no progress visual placed at the top of the paywall).

**Variant:** Goal‑gradient progress presentation: add a progress bar or filling container showing progress toward daily/session goals; show a 100‑day challenge visual with a dynamic calendar/streak/countdown marking today and the target completion date; include a "You're X days away from the first paid feature" message; place the visual prominently at the top of the paywall.

---

## Measure cannibalization explicitly by cohort

**Description:** Compare baseline expected full-price sales against actuals for discount-exposed cohorts to quantify cannibalization and validate that targeting reduces it versus blanket campaigns.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that targeting discounts by cohort will reduce cannibalization of full-price sales compared to blanket campaigns because discount-exposed cohorts will show smaller gaps between baseline expected full-price sales and actuals.

**Control:** Run a blanket discount campaign and, for discount-exposed cohorts, compare baseline expected full-price sales to actuals to quantify cannibalization.

**Variant:** Run targeted discounting to selected cohorts and, for those discount-exposed cohorts, compare baseline expected full-price sales to actuals; evaluate whether the gap (cannibalization) is reduced versus the blanket campaign.

---

## BOGO vs Percentage Discount Conversion Test

**Description:** Test a buy‑one‑get‑one‑free offer versus a flat‑percentage discount to determine which format drives higher conversion without eroding LTV.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that the offer format (buy‑one‑get‑one‑free vs flat‑percentage discount) will affect conversion, and that one format will drive higher conversion without eroding LTV.

**Control:** Flat‑percentage discount offer.

**Variant:** Buy‑one‑get‑one‑free offer.

---

## Standardize Discounted Sale Page/Paywall; Vary Only Discount Across Promotions

**Description:** Test whether reusing a proven, high-performing discounted sale page/paywall with a stable layout across seasonal sales and promotions—changing only the discount amount—maintains conversion and enables faster launches, compared to creating or modifying layouts for each campaign.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that reusing a stable, high-converting discounted sale page/paywall and varying only the discount amount across promotions will maintain conversion and allow faster launches, because keeping the layout consistent avoids unintended conversion drops—even if there is a potential effectiveness trade-off versus bespoke layouts.

**Control:** For each seasonal sale or promotion, use a promotion-specific sale page/paywall where the layout is created or modified for that campaign (discount value may also change).

**Variant:** Reuse the same proven, high-performing discounted sale page/paywall across promotions; keep the layout constant and change only the discount amount.

---

## Close Button Visibility on Soft Paywalls

**Description:** Systematically test close button visibility states (visible, hidden, delayed) on soft paywalls, monitoring confusion reports against revenue lift to identify the optimal balance.

**Hypothesis:** Varying the close button visibility (visible vs hidden vs delayed) will lead to different levels of confusion reports and revenue, and at least one state will provide higher revenue without an unacceptable increase in confusion.

**Control:** Soft paywall with a visible close button.

**Variant:** Two variants: (1) hidden close button; (2) delayed close button (close button appears after a delay).

---

## Keep legacy in‑app offer flows live during price tests

**Description:** Test whether maintaining legacy in‑app offer flows during price experiments avoids short‑term revenue hits. Accept temporary inconsistencies in displayed percent discounts and update offers only after selecting new winners.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that keeping legacy in‑app offer flows live during price tests will protect short‑term revenue compared to turning them off during the test, because existing offers remain available until new winners are chosen.

**Control:** During price tests, legacy in‑app offer flows are turned off; only the test prices/offers are shown.

**Variant:** During price tests, legacy in‑app offer flows remain live, even if the displayed percent discounts are temporarily inconsistent; update all offers after choosing the new winners.

---

## A/B test: “Note from the team” paywall vs. standard paywall

**Description:** Test whether a candid, human “note from the team” message—explaining a trial due to demand—improves paywall performance compared to the standard design. This approach has won in multiple cases and was tested directly as a creative variant by one team. The goal is to see if perceived authenticity boosts conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a candid “note from the team” explaining a trial/demand to the paywall will increase conversion versus the standard paywall because perceived authenticity boosts conversion and this approach has won in multiple cases.

**Control:** Current standard paywall design without a candid “note from the team” narrative.

**Variant:** Paywall including a candid, human “note from the team” message that explains a trial due to demand (creative narrative variant).

---

## Persistent home-screen banner to reopen the sale after dismissal

**Description:** If a user closes the initial sale paywall, keep a fixed banner on the home screen that links back to the deal so it’s easy to find again.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a fixed home-screen banner linking back to the deal for users who close the initial sale paywall will increase the likelihood they reopen the deal because it remains easy to find again.

**Control:** After closing the initial sale paywall, no fixed home-screen banner is shown linking back to the deal.

**Variant:** After closing the initial sale paywall, a fixed banner remains on the home screen that links back to the deal.

---

## Small Pre-Authorization on Web Free Trials

**Description:** Test whether placing a small pre-authorization (e.g., $1) on web free trial signups reduces payment method fraud and billing issues while maintaining trial uptake.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a small pre-authorization (e.g., $1) to web free trial signups will reduce payment method fraud and billing issues without decreasing trial uptake because of the added pre-authorization step.

**Control:** Current web free trial signup flow with no pre-authorization on the payment method.

**Variant:** Web free trial signup flow that includes a small pre-authorization (e.g., $1) on the payment method at signup.

---

## Compliance-conscious paywall pricing and discount messaging

**Description:** Test displaying the actual reference price and billing terms alongside relative savings, clearly showing the full annual price and plan duration near the CTA, and avoiding ambiguous per‑month equivalents for annual plans (and any equivalent prices larger than full plan prices) to support review compliance and improve clarity.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that explicitly showing the reference price and billing terms with relative savings, plus clearly presenting the full annual price and plan duration near the CTA (and avoiding per‑month equivalents for annual plans where prohibited), will improve review compliance and clarity because it prevents users from having to compute pricing and avoids emphasizing equivalent prices over full plan prices.

**Control:** Paywall shows relative savings (e.g., “50% off”) without the actual reference price or billing terms; emphasizes a monthly equivalent for annual plans; plan duration is not shown near the CTA; users must compute full pricing; equivalent prices may be presented larger than the full plan price.

**Variant:** Paywall displays the actual reference price next to any relative savings and includes billing terms on-screen; shows the full annual price (not just a monthly equivalent) and includes the plan duration near the CTA; avoids using per‑month equivalents for annual plans if guidelines prohibit it; ensures any equivalent prices are not presented larger than the full plan price.

---

## Route web-billed users from in-app settings to a hosted subscription portal

**Description:** Provide an in-app “Manage Subscription” link in the subscription settings that sends web-billed users to a hosted customer portal (not the app store page) where they can manage, pause, or cancel. This aims to reduce support needs and improve retention.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that routing web-billed users to a hosted customer portal from the app’s subscription settings (instead of the app store page) will reduce support requests and improve retention because users can manage, pause, or cancel directly in the portal.

**Control:** In the app’s subscription settings, web purchasers are routed to the app store subscription management page.

**Variant:** In the app’s subscription settings, web purchasers see a “Manage Subscription” link that opens a hosted customer portal where they can manage, pause, or cancel their subscription.

---

## Win‑back: “Same service, lower price” framing with limited‑time discount

**Description:** Test whether explicitly framing a win‑back discount as keeping the same benefits for less, paired with a time‑boxed offer, outperforms generic discount language in driving quick reactivation.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a limited‑time win‑back offer framed as “same service, lower price” (i.e., same benefits for less) will result in higher reactivation than generic discount language because it highlights keeping the same benefits for less and sets a time‑boxed window to motivate quick reactivation.

**Control:** Win‑back outreach that uses generic discount language, without explicitly stating that the subscriber gets the same service for a lower price.

**Variant:** A time‑boxed win‑back discount framed as “same service, lower price,” explicitly stating the subscriber gets the same benefits for less to motivate quick reactivation.

---

## Dedicated paywall placement with native code redemption and parameterized offers

**Description:** Test routing users who engage with referral/promo/offer code flows into a dedicated paywall placement. Use OS-native code redemption triggered from the paywall and pass a parameter for the entered/redeemed code to show tailored copy and the correct discounted products (including extended trial or specific pricing SKUs). This isolates the code-redemption cohort so the main paywall experiment remains unaffected.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using the native code redemption UI and routing all users who enter or attempt to redeem a referral/promo code to a dedicated paywall placement with tailored copy and code-specific products (e.g., extended trial or specific SKUs) will perform better for this cohort because they behave differently and expect the correct discounted products and messaging when a code is involved.

**Control:** Existing paywall flow without dedicated code-redemption routing: no user parameter is set for referral/promo codes, no dedicated placement or tailored copy/offers, and no OS-native code redemption is triggered from the paywall.

**Variant:** From the paywall, trigger the OS’s native promo/offer code redemption UI via a custom action. Whether redemption is successful or canceled, route the user to a dedicated paywall placement tailored for code-redemption journeys. Set and carry a user parameter for the entered/redeemed code, and in this placement show the correct discounted products and copy, including an extended trial (e.g., 14 days) or specific pricing SKUs. The main experiment remains unaffected by scoping changes only to this cohort.

---

## UTM-Attributed, Threshold-Triggered Product Upsells from Paywalls

**Description:** Test appending identifiers/UTMs to storefront links from paywalls and triggering discounted product upsell offers at specific performance milestones (e.g., strength thresholds) with dynamic SKU routing and UTMs. This aims to attribute physical product revenue to specific paywall variants/placements and optimize upsell ROI.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that appending identifiers/UTMs to paywall storefront links and triggering milestone-based, discounted cross-sell offers that dynamically route to the correct SKU (with UTMs) will enable attribution of purchases to specific paywall variants/placements and increase upsell ROI because offers are timely, relevant, and trackable.

**Control:** No changes applied: paywalls link to storefront without appended identifiers/UTMs; no performance-threshold-triggered upsell offers with discount or dynamic SKU routing; links do not include UTMs for attribution.

**Variant:** Append identifiers/UTMs to all storefront links from paywalls to attribute purchases to specific paywall variants and placements. When users reach defined performance milestones (e.g., strength thresholds), trigger a product upsell offer that includes a discount and dynamically routes to the correct SKU page; include UTM parameters on these triggered links for attribution.

---

## Baseline and Audit Paywall/Payment Error Rate

**Description:** Audit the percentage of users who encounter paywall or payment errors to identify lost revenue opportunities. Establish a baseline incidence to size the opportunity and validate prioritization. This is low-hanging fruit and commonly present, especially in larger apps.

**Hypothesis:** We believe a non-trivial percentage of users encounter paywall or payment errors; measuring the baseline incidence will size the opportunity and validate prioritization, as these issues are commonly present, especially in larger apps.

**Control:** Current state without an audit; the share of users hitting paywall or payment errors is not baselined or quantified.

**Variant:** Audit and quantify the share (percentage) of users who encounter paywall or payment errors.

---

## Clean split: pure in‑app vs. pure web checkout using unchanged paywall

**Description:** Test the app‑to‑web trade‑off by routing an unchanged paywall either entirely to in‑app checkout or entirely to web checkout. This clean split avoids dual CTAs to isolate and quantify pure friction and proceeds impact before layering discounts or UX changes.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sending the unchanged paywall to either all in‑app or all web checkout (with no dual CTAs) will isolate and quantify the pure friction cost and proceeds impact of web checkout, because it avoids confounding from discounts, UX changes, and multiple purchase methods.

**Control:** Unchanged existing paywall where all purchase CTAs route to native in‑app checkout only (no web option; no discounts or UX changes).

**Variant:** The same unchanged paywall where all purchase CTAs route to web checkout only (no in‑app option; no discounts or UX changes; no dual CTAs).

---

## Final-Page Social Proof vs Trial Timeline on Multi‑Page Paywall

**Description:** Test placing social proof on the final decision screen of a multi‑page paywall instead of relying on timeline/trial graphics. Multiple sources report that last‑page social proof (ratings, reviews, testimonials, press/awards) improved conversion/close rates and reduced cancellations versus timeline explainers, which may be ignored or make the countdown salient. This matters because reinforcing trust at the moment of choice lifted trial conversion, including for new users, and past results favored last‑page social proof over timeline visuals.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing social proof (ratings, real review snippets, short testimonials, press/awards badges) on the final decision page—replacing or minimizing timeline/trial graphics—will increase trust at the moment of choice, leading to higher conversion/close rates and fewer cancellations (especially for new users), because social proof reassures right before purchase while timeline countdowns can be ignored or make the trial end overly salient.

**Control:** Multi‑page paywall where the final page features timeline/trial explainer graphics and education content. Any social proof, if present, appears on earlier screens rather than the final decision page.

**Variant:** Multi‑page paywall where the final page prominently surfaces social proof in bento‑style blocks: app ratings, large testimonial or short review snippets, awards/badges, and ‘as seen in’ press logos. Timeline/trial graphics are replaced or moved earlier in the flow (if retained) so the last step focuses on social proof at the decision moment.

---

## Post-abandonment/winback first-week paid intro price: $2.99 vs $0.99

**Description:** Test a paid intro price for the first week after abandonment or in winback flows that automatically renews at the standard weekly price. Compare a modest discount ($2.99) to a steep entry price ($0.99). Keep messaging crystal clear to avoid perceived bait-and-switch. Monitor perceived trust and long-term ARPU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using a paid first-week intro price that auto-renews at the standard weekly price, with crystal-clear messaging, will maintain perceived trust; comparing $2.99 versus $0.99 in abandonment/winback contexts will affect long-term ARPU.

**Control:** First-week paid intro price of $2.99 after abandonment or in winback; automatically renews at the standard weekly price. Messaging is crystal clear about the first-week price and subsequent renewal.

**Variant:** First-week paid intro price of $0.99 after abandonment or in winback; automatically renews at the standard weekly price. Messaging is crystal clear about the first-week price and subsequent renewal.

---

## Audience-per-Experiment with Paused Cohorts and Layered Rollouts for Clean LTV Attribution

**Description:** Test running each paywall experiment in its own fresh audience and pausing (not deleting) it after the exposure window. This aims to preserve a clean experiment history and keep renewals/cancellations and long-term proceeds per user attributed to the originating variant. While long-tail price tests mature (e.g., 2–4 weeks for retention reads), layer faster design/messaging tests in new audiences. Apply the same start/pause approach to timebound promos so cohorts continue attributing to the promo variant for true performance readouts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that creating a new audience per experiment (or variant batch) and pausing it after exposure—while layering faster tests as slower ones mature—will result in cleaner history and accurate long-term attribution (renewals, cancellations, proceeds per user, trial-to-paid) to the original variant, enabling true winners to be picked later, compared to mixing variants across time or deleting completed tests.

**Control:** - Experiments share or reuse audiences, mixing variants across time.
- Completed tests are stopped or deleted rather than paused.
- Price tests remain live while waiting on retention data.
- Promo offers are run without dedicated start/pause audiences.
- Renewals may attribute to whatever is currently live rather than the originating variant, making long-term analysis harder.

**Variant:** - For each experiment (or batch of variants), create a new audience containing only those variants so start times align; pause the prior audience.
- Run short-run tests only until enough trials start to form cohorts; pause after the exposure window. For price tests, pause after exposure and attribute renewals back to the original paywall; pick true winners later (e.g., 2–4 weeks).
- Keep audiences paused (not deleted) so renewals/cancellations and long-term proceeds per user continue attributing to the variant that acquired the user, enabling LTV analysis months later.
- Stagger rollouts: start new experiments by resuming the audience in your testing campaign and pausing prior ones to maintain a clear history without affecting live users.
- For limited-time promos, start and pause dedicated promo audiences for the event window; let ongoing renewals continue attributing to the promo cohort.
- When data matures, judge winners by proceeds per user (net of store fees) and trial-to-paid, and combine winners from layered tests.

## Single-screen with leading product visuals/video, badges, and compact feature list above CTA

**Description:** Test a compact single-screen that leads with big product visuals or a short top-performing UGC/ad video and pairs with top badges plus a short, visual feature list (carousel) above the CTA to communicate value quickly, set expectations, balance trust and clarity without heavy text, and improve trial-to-paid rates.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with big product visuals or a short top-performing UGC/ad video, combined with top badges and a short visual feature list (carousel) above the CTA in a compact single-screen, will communicate value quickly, set expectations, balance trust and clarity without heavy text, and improve trial-to-paid rates.

**Control:** Current screen design as-is.

**Variant:** Replace the current screen with a compact single-screen layout that leads with big product visuals or a short top-performing UGC/ad video; shows top badges (social proof) and a short, visual feature list presented as a compact feature carousel; places these elements above the primary CTA; and minimizes heavy text.

---

## Test “Accept Offer” CTA on discounted/cheaper (recovery) offers

**Description:** Evaluate replacing a generic CTA with “Accept Offer” when presenting discounted or cheaper offers (including recovery offers). Prior testing indicated ~5% improvement with “Accept offer.” The goal is to increase acceptance clarity and conversions. Systematically A/B test CTA verbs and, where applicable, the microcopy under the CTA.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using “Accept Offer” as the CTA on discounted/cheaper (recovery) offers will increase conversions versus a generic CTA because the clear, affirmative wording improves acceptance clarity, and a prior test showed ~5% gain for “Accept offer.”

**Control:** Current experience uses a generic CTA on discounted/cheaper (recovery) offer screens; any existing microcopy under the CTA remains unchanged.

**Variant:** Replace the generic CTA with “Accept Offer” on discounted/cheaper (recovery) offer screens; keep any existing microcopy under the CTA the same for this test. (Microcopy can be A/B tested separately.)

## Single template paywall using reusable, parameterized snippets and localization

**Description:** Test whether consolidating paywall builds into a single template composed of reusable snippets (e.g., footers, product/plan selectors, CTA blocks, exit modal/drawer, social proof row, long‑form feature lists) wired to variables and parameters, plus localization via string uploads and clear naming/organization, reduces build time and errors, maintains styling consistency, and keeps pricing/copy experiments scalable while delivering feature‑relevant content.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using a single template paywall built from reusable snippets wired to variables (price, period, reason) and a feature‑type parameter (to dynamically update image and copy), organized with a clear naming convention and localized via string uploads, will reduce build time and production errors, maintain consistent styling, and enable faster, scalable pricing/copy tests compared to manually duplicating components and creating separate paywalls per feature/market.

**Control:** Current approach where multiple paywalls and variants are created and edited independently: recurring sections (e.g., footers, product/plan selectors, CTA blocks, exit modals, fixed footer, exit drawer, social proof row, long‑form feature lists) are built or updated manually; copy is localized manually per market; complex CTA elements and their rules are replicated by hand; separate audiences/paywalls are created per feature context; updates are applied instance‑by‑instance without the consolidated naming/organization described below.

**Variant:** Implement a single template paywall that: (1) Saves frequently used sections as reusable snippets (footers, product/plan selectors, CTA block, exit modal, fixed footer/exit drawer, social proof row, long‑form feature lists); (2) Wires dynamic content to variables (price, period, reason) so updates propagate across paywalls; (3) Uses a feature‑type parameter to dynamically update the paywall’s image and copy for different gated features instead of creating separate audiences/paywalls; (4) Saves complex CTA elements (with rules) as reusable snippets to avoid error‑prone manual replication; (5) Applies localization via localize string uploads so template keys switch per market; (6) Adopts a clear naming convention to organize paywalls and snippets for faster iteration and reduced production errors.

## Pre-approved per-country generic SKU pool vs just-in-time SKU creation for price tests

**Description:** Test whether creating a pool of pre-approved store SKUs per country using generic identifiers and adjusting prices at launch improves price test execution versus creating SKUs on demand. This matters to increase deployment speed, reduce operational overhead, avoid store approval bottlenecks, and ensure winners are ready for high-demand (peak) periods. Measure deployment speed and operational overhead.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that building a pool of pre-approved SKUs per country with generic identifiers (e.g., tier/country) and adjusting price at test time will increase deployment speed, reduce operational overhead, avoid store approval bottlenecks, and ensure price-test winners are in place by peak season compared to creating SKUs on demand.

**Control:** Create SKUs on demand when launching each price test in each market. Submit products for store review at the time of test launch, set pricing at creation, and schedule tests as needed, including close to or during peak periods.

**Variant:** Create all needed SKUs per country weeks ahead of peak season and submit them for store review early using generic identifiers (e.g., tier/country naming). Avoid labels like “price test” in IDs. Maintain this pre-approved SKU pool and adjust prices later at test launch, lining up per-market price tests in advance so winners are in place for high-demand periods.

## Pay-What-You-Want Selector for Annual Billing

**Description:** Test adding multiple annual price points (or a slider) under a “pay what you think is fair” concept—each with the same trial—to see if goodwill and choice increase conversion and ARPU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a “pay what you think is fair” selector with multiple annual price points (or a slider), while keeping the trial the same, will raise overall conversion and ARPU because goodwill and choice positively influence purchase decisions.

**Control:** Current annual billing purchase flow without a “pay what you think is fair” selector.

**Variant:** Annual billing purchase flow with a “pay what you think is fair” selector offering multiple annual price points (or a slider); all options include the same trial.

---

## Make refund rate a core KPI across monetization variants

**Description:** Test adding refund rate to the experiment scorecard and tracking it by variant and exit-offer type to improve decision quality. Exit offers (e.g., a monthly pass) can show higher refund rates, and pushing harder to annual can raise refunds. Tracking refund deltas alongside proceeds per user helps avoid optimizing for short-term trial starts only. In one prior test, a monthly exit-offer variant reduced refunds by ~33% while maintaining or improving revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that making refund rate a core KPI and monitoring it per product/variant and exit-offer type will lead us to select variants that maintain or improve revenue while reducing refunds, because refund behavior varies across exit offers and more aggressive annual pushes.

**Control:** Current scorecard and decision process that optimizes for trial starts/proceeds without including refund rate as a core KPI and without breaking out refunds by product/variant or exit-offer type.

**Variant:** A scorecard and decision process that (1) includes refund rate as a core KPI, (2) tracks refund rate and deltas by product/variant and exit-offer type (e.g., monthly pass), and (3) reports it alongside proceeds per user to weigh long-term impact versus short-term proceeds when declaring winners, including for variants that push harder to annual.

---

## Conditional family‑sharing display in non‑trial flows

**Description:** Test showing the family‑sharing plan only when trials aren’t available, and placing it alongside annual, quarterly, monthly, and lifetime options in the non‑trial flow, versus always showing family‑sharing. This matters to capture incremental revenue from households while monitoring potential choice overload.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing the family‑sharing plan only when trials aren’t available—and including it alongside annual, quarterly, monthly, and lifetime options—will increase incremental revenue by better capturing households; we will also measure choice overload compared to always showing the family‑sharing plan.

**Control:** Family‑sharing plan is always shown across paywall flows (including when trials are available).

**Variant:** When trials aren’t available (non‑trial flow), include a family‑sharing SKU alongside annual, quarterly, monthly, and lifetime options; hide the family‑sharing plan when trials are available.

---

## Automate multi-country price updates

**Description:** Test whether using APIs or internal tooling to streamline bulk price management across countries and SKUs reduces friction in price testing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that automating multi-country price updates via APIs or internal tooling will streamline bulk price management across countries and SKUs and reduce friction in price testing.

**Control:** Maintain the existing process for updating prices across countries and SKUs.

**Variant:** Implement APIs or internal tooling to automate bulk price updates across countries and SKUs.

---

## CTA prominence vs. close affordance A/B test

**Description:** A/A checks revealed UI sensitivity: conversion can skew when the purchase button is small or the close is dominant. This experiment tests whether making the purchase CTA larger and higher-contrast, while de-emphasizing the close, prevents design-driven suppression and artificial conversion gaps.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that increasing the size and contrast of the purchase button and reducing the prominence of the close affordance will increase conversion and reduce A/A discrepancies because the current design can skew behavior when the CTA is small or the close is dominant.

**Control:** Current UI with existing purchase button size/contrast and current close affordance prominence.

**Variant:** Larger, high-contrast purchase CTA and a less prominent close affordance.

---

## Unified Multi-Placement In-App Campaign

**Description:** Group similar in-app placements into a single campaign and run one A/B test across onboarding, library banner click, and limit-hit so price or messaging tests apply consistently across entry points, reducing configuration overhead and user confusion while controlling for slot heterogeneity.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that bundling onboarding, library banner click, and limit-hit placements into one unified campaign with the same price or messaging test will reduce configuration overhead and user confusion and produce cleaner A/B readouts by controlling for slot heterogeneity.

**Control:** Run separate, per-placement campaigns (unbundled), where price or messaging tests are executed independently for each slot.

**Variant:** Run a single unified campaign that bundles onboarding, library banner click, and limit-hit placements into one A/B test, applying the same price or messaging treatment consistently across all placements.

---

## Prioritize high-traffic in-app paywall experiments before onboarding when onboarding risk is high

**Description:** When onboarding is fragile or undergoing changes, begin experiments on high-traffic in-app feature paywalls (e.g., “Likes Received,” “Picks”) to reduce risk while still learning quickly, then expand to onboarding later.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prioritizing experiments on high-traffic in-app feature paywalls (e.g., “Likes Received,” “Picks”) before onboarding, when onboarding is fragile or under change, will reduce risk and still provide fast learning because these paywalls receive high traffic and avoid destabilizing onboarding.

**Control:** Proceed with onboarding experiments first, even while onboarding is fragile or under change.

**Variant:** Defer onboarding experiments until stability improves; instead, run experiments first on high-traffic in-app feature paywalls such as “Likes Received” and “Picks,” then expand to onboarding afterward.

---

## Aha Acceleration: 5-second Demo Before Paywall + Guided Practice After Onboarding

**Description:** Test whether showing a brief interactive core feature demo before the paywall and adding a guided practice step immediately after onboarding (using a sample link or demo content to complete a key action) shortens time-to-value and improves key outcomes compared to the current experience.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a 5-second interactive live core feature demo before the paywall and then guiding users through a practice step right after onboarding (via a sample link or demo content to complete a key action) will trigger the aha moment faster, shorten time-to-value, and increase conversion, trial starts, and retention compared to a static screenshot and no guided practice.

**Control:** Before paywall: a static screenshot of the core feature. After onboarding: no guided practice step.

**Variant:** Before paywall: a 5-second interactive demo of the core feature. After onboarding: a guided practice step using a sample link or demo content to complete a key action.

---

## Display the larger absolute savings number and remove vague labels on the paywall

**Description:** Test showing either X% OFF or $Y OFF—whichever is a larger absolute number—and avoiding vague labels like “Most Popular” or “Save X%” on the paywall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing whichever discount (X% OFF or $Y OFF) yields the larger absolute number and avoiding vague labels like “Most Popular” or “Save X%” will perform better than the current presentation.

**Control:** Paywall messaging includes vague labels such as “Most Popular” or “Save X%” and does not ensure the displayed discount is whichever (percentage or dollar) results in the larger absolute number.

**Variant:** Paywall displays the discount as either X% OFF or $Y OFF—whichever is the larger absolute number—and removes vague labels like “Most Popular” and “Save X%”.

---

## Concise plan value breakdown

**Description:** Test adding a plain-language summary on the paywall that explains what’s included in monthly vs. yearly plans to reassure users and support conversions.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a concise, plain-language breakdown of what’s included in monthly vs. yearly plans on the paywall will reassure users and support conversions.

**Control:** Current paywall without a concise, plain-language summary comparing what’s included in monthly vs. yearly plans.

**Variant:** Paywall displays a concise, plain-language breakdown of what’s included in monthly vs. yearly plans.

---

## Post-purchase onboarding interstitial

**Description:** Immediately after purchase, show a lightweight screen that congratulates the user and highlights "what to do first" to reach the aha moment, reducing early churn.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that immediately showing a lightweight, congratulatory screen highlighting what to do first will reduce early churn by guiding users to the aha moment faster.

**Control:** After purchase, users proceed without an additional onboarding interstitial.

**Variant:** Immediately after purchase, show a lightweight, congratulatory interstitial that highlights what to do first to reach the aha moment.

---

## Precise discount percentages and optimized price endings

**Description:** Test whether using specific discount figures (e.g., 23% instead of 20%) and optimized price endings (e.g., .99) improves conversion while preserving value perception by signaling a well-considered offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using precise discount percentages (e.g., 23% vs. 20%) and .99 price endings will signal a well-considered offer and maximize conversion while maintaining value perception.

**Control:** Rounded discount percentages (e.g., 20%) with existing, non-optimized price endings.

**Variant:** Use specific discount figures (e.g., 23%) and apply optimized price endings (e.g., .99).

---

## Single Subscription Group for All Pricing Tests

**Description:** Test whether placing all price points and pricing test products in one subscription group prevents wrong entitlement states and double‑subscription edge cases, while simplifying refunds/support and reducing support/review risk.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that consolidating all subscription variants and pricing test products into a single subscription group will prevent users from entering a wrong entitlement state due to caching and avoid accidental double subscriptions, which will simplify refunds/support and reduce support/review risk.

**Control:** Run price tests across multiple subscription groups. Users can subscribe to multiple products, increasing the chance of being in a wrong entitlement state if entitlements cache incorrectly, and making refunds/support more complex.

**Variant:** Keep all price points and pricing test products within a single subscription group for all subscription variants to avoid double‑subscription edge cases from entitlement cache issues and to simplify refunds/support.

---

## Minimize concurrent animations to focus on the CTA

**Description:** Test whether limiting concurrent bouncing/animated elements on the paywall to a single focal animation improves clarity around the CTA by reducing distraction.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that keeping only one focal animation (e.g., a subtle timer or button animation) will make the CTA clearer because multiple simultaneous animations can distract from it.

**Control:** Paywall includes multiple simultaneous bouncing/animated elements near or around the CTA.

**Variant:** Paywall limits motion to one focal animation (e.g., a subtle timer or a subtle button animation), with all other concurrent animations removed.

---

## Menu upgrade placement optimizations

**Description:** Given strong intent via the menu upgrade placement, test headline/copy/design prominence changes there to further lift conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that increasing the prominence of the headline/copy/design in the menu upgrade placement will increase conversion because users show strong intent in that location.

**Control:** Current menu upgrade placement with existing headline, copy, and design prominence as-is.

**Variant:** Menu upgrade placement with more prominent headline, copy, and design.

---

## Limit transactional discounts to one-time per user

**Description:** Apply a hard cap so each user only sees or receives a transactional discount once to prevent discount chasing and protect long-term monetization.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that limiting transactional discounts to a one-time per user exposure/receipt will prevent discount chasing and protect long-term monetization.

**Control:** No cap: users can see or receive transactional discounts multiple times.

**Variant:** Hard cap: once a user has seen or received a transactional discount once, they are not shown or granted additional transactional discounts.

---

## Make Monthly Plan Optional by Removing It from the Primary Ladder

**Description:** Test whether treating the monthly plan as optional improves outcomes. Prior observed tests indicated that monthly underperformed weekly and longer intervals on retention and proceeds. This experiment evaluates removing monthly from the primary purchase ladder.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the monthly plan from the primary ladder (making it optional via a secondary path) will increase overall retention and proceeds because monthly has underperformed weekly and longer intervals in observed tests.

**Control:** The primary purchase ladder prominently includes the monthly plan alongside weekly and longer-interval plans.

**Variant:** The monthly plan is removed from the primary purchase ladder; only weekly and longer-interval plans are shown. Monthly remains accessible only via a secondary path.

---

## AI-first, text-based paywall localization with style guides, CSV QA, and device-locale selection

**Description:** Test whether an AI-assisted localization pipeline—using per-language tone/style guides, CSV export/review/re-import, and a text-based UI—accelerates paywall localization while maintaining quality. The approach avoids text embedded in images/animations (overlay text instead), drives locale selection from the device locale, keeps copy minimal (prioritizing button and price/renewal strings), leverages a built-in one-click AI translation engine, preserves variables/placeholders, and only customizes images that differ by language.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that generating translations with a built-in AI engine in one click, guided by per-language tone/style guides (e.g., formal/informal), then running human QA via CSV before re-import—applied to a text-based paywall that avoids text-in-images/animations and overlays text—while driving locale from device settings, keeping copy sparse (starting with button and price/renewal strings), preserving variables/placeholders, and customizing only images that differ, will reduce localization time and maintain translation quality.

**Control:** Current paywall localization process and assets remain as-is (no changes to workflow, copy, or asset handling).

**Variant:** Implement the AI-assisted workflow: (1) Export localization keys/strings as CSV (including variables/placeholders) and keep placeholders intact. (2) Use a built-in AI translation engine to generate localized paywall text in one click, applying per-language tone/style guides (formal/informal) during generation. (3) Conduct human QA for contextual accuracy and correct formal/informal forms via CSV review, then re-import approved strings. (4) Ensure the paywall uses text-based UI elements: avoid text embedded in images and animations; overlay text for easy localization and iteration. (5) Drive locale selection from the device locale. (6) Keep copy minimal; prioritize localizing button copy and price/renewal strings first to ship quickly. (7) Customize only images that differ between languages.

## Concentrated Pricing Blitz vs Continuous Small Tests (Single-Cohort Baseline)

**Description:** Test, especially for mature businesses, whether running many price variants in a defined short window (about two weeks to a month, e.g., 10–20 variants) and then reverting to the main price yields cleaner comparisons and faster decisions than a steady stream of smaller, continuous tests. Compare operational cost, cohort cleanliness, and decision speed. The blitz uses a single cohort so all variants share the same baseline, enabling tighter confidence intervals and easier comparison, with evaluation over time as cohorts mature and retention baked into results.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that clustering price tests into a concentrated blitz with a single cohort will produce cleaner cohorts, tighter confidence intervals, and faster decision-making than a continuous stream of smaller tests because all variants run within the same defined window against a shared baseline, with consistent time windows and retention effects baked into results, and prices revert to the main price after the window to enable clean cohort readouts over time.

**Control:** Current approach: a steady stream of smaller, continuous pricing tests (no defined windowed blitz), evaluated as they roll out over time.

**Variant:** Concentrated pricing blitz: run many price variants (e.g., 10–20) in a single, short block (two weeks to a month) using a single cohort so all price variants are measured against the same baseline (e.g., 70% control, 10% additional control, 10% variant). After the window, revert to the main price and evaluate results as cohorts mature.

---

## Delay paywall after share and notification entry

**Description:** Test delaying the paywall when triggered by sharing or by entering from a push notification. Delay 10–30 seconds (0.2–0.5 minutes) after a share event to avoid interrupting the system share sheet, and delay 60 seconds after notification entry to avoid intercepting task‑oriented intent (replying/viewing). Include a one‑time exposure limit to prevent annoyance.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that delaying the paywall 10–30 seconds after a share event and 60 seconds after entering from a push notification, with a one‑time exposure limit, will avoid interrupting the system share sheet and task‑oriented intent (replying/viewing) and prevent annoyance.

**Control:** Paywall appears without delay around sharing and upon entering from a push notification.

**Variant:** Delay the paywall 10–30 seconds (0.2–0.5 minutes) after the share event and 60 seconds after entering from a push notification. Add a one‑time exposure limit. This aims to avoid interrupting the system share sheet and task‑oriented intent (replying/viewing).

---

## Selective Plan Discounting to Protect Perceived Value

**Description:** Test whether applying discounts only to select plans (e.g., lifetime) during sales, while keeping other plans at standard pricing, maintains perceived value and shapes plan mix compared to discounting the entire lineup. This matters because frequent discounts can cheapen perceived value, especially for sensitive brands.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that disciplined, plan-specific discounts during sales (e.g., discounting only the lifetime plan) while keeping other plans at standard pricing will better preserve perceived value and shape plan mix than discounting the entire lineup, because frequent discounts can cheapen perceived value, especially for sensitive brands.

**Control:** During a sale, apply a discount across the entire plan lineup.

**Variant:** During a sale, apply the discount only to specific plan(s) (e.g., lifetime) and keep all other plans at standard pricing to shape mix and maintain perceived value, especially for sensitive brands.

---

## Platform-specific compliant paywalls with reviewer-friendly abandon/restore templates

**Description:** Test whether adopting transparent, platform-specific compliant paywall designs and clean, reviewer-friendly templates for restore/abandon flows reduces policy rejections and refunds on platforms with stricter design reviews that aim to prevent dark patterns.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that aligning paywalls with platform-specific review guidelines and using simple, reviewer-friendly templates for transaction abandon/restore flows will reduce review rejections and refunds because they avoid aggressive patterns and increase transparency.

**Control:** Current paywall and restore/abandon flow designs that are not tailored to platform-specific review requirements and may include aggressive patterns that trigger policy rejections.

**Variant:** Implement transparent, platform-specific compliant paywalls and replace restore/abandon flows with clean, reviewer-friendly templates known to pass review, explicitly avoiding aggressive patterns.

---

## Paywall theme: system-matched vs forced high-contrast (light/dark)

**Description:** Test the impact of matching the paywall’s theme to the device/app theme versus forcing a single high-contrast theme. Teams have seen mixed results: aligning to system theme lifted conversion in some cases, while a fixed theme outperformed in others. Theme mismatches can hurt conversion, but a deliberate pattern break (e.g., forcing dark) can sometimes convert better. Ensure text color and contrast are confirmed per theme. Auto-detect system theme and/or accept a theme user parameter to match app appearance on the paywall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that matching the paywall to the system/app theme with confirmed text contrast will improve conversion because theme mismatches can hurt; however, a deliberately mismatched, higher-contrast forced theme (e.g., always dark) may outperform due to a pattern-break effect. This test will determine which approach converts better for this product.

**Control:** Responsive paywall that auto-detects and matches the user’s system/app theme (light/dark). If a theme user parameter exists, honor it. Confirm text color and contrast per theme for readability.

**Variant:** Force a single high-contrast theme for all users regardless of system/app theme (e.g., always dark), treating the theme shift as a pattern break. Confirm text color and contrast for readability.

---

## Operationalize promotions and rollouts via audience toggling and ordering

**Description:** Test managing weekly promotions and staged rollouts by pausing/unpausing prebuilt “discount” audiences, restoring “normal price” audiences, and ordering audiences top-to-bottom so targeted segments (e.g., referral users, seasonal campaigns) pre-empt the general audience. This aims to reduce engineering effort, speed recurring sale operations, and enable quick on/off switching by moving or pausing audiences.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running promotions and rollouts by toggling prebuilt audiences (discount vs. normal price) and enforcing top-to-bottom audience ordering where targeted segments pre-empt the general audience will reduce engineering effort, speed recurring sale operations, and allow safe, quick switching of tests because changes are made by pausing/moving audiences rather than code.

**Control:** Promotions and rollouts are managed via code; audiences are not explicitly ordered to pre-empt the general audience; switching tests or sales requires engineering effort and is slower.

**Variant:** Use prebuilt “discount” and “normal price” audiences; order audiences top-to-bottom with targeted segments (e.g., referral users, seasonal campaigns) above the general audience; run weekly promotions by pausing/unpausing the “discount” audiences and restoring the “normal price” audiences afterwards; switch tests on/off quickly by moving or pausing audiences instead of using code.

---

## Variant-ID Instrumentation with Holdout for App-Launch Paywalls

**Description:** Test whether instrumenting analytics with experiment_id, variant_id, and paywall_id and using a measurable holdout for app-launch paywalls enables accurate attribution of incremental lift and variant-level cohort analysis (retention, refunds, plan mix, post-purchase engagement). Analysis is based on variant IDs (which map one-to-one to a paywall within a specific experiment audience), not paywall IDs that can appear in multiple contexts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that basing analysis on experiment/variant IDs and adding a measurable holdout to app-launch paywalls will attribute incremental lift and reveal differences in retention, refunds, plan mix, and post-purchase engagement across variants (beyond initial conversions), because the same paywall can appear in multiple contexts and variant IDs uniquely map a paywall to a specific experiment audience.

**Control:** Current app-launch paywall campaigns without a measurable holdout. Paywall and transaction events are keyed to paywall IDs (and may not include experiment_id/variant_id). Analytics comparisons, when performed, are not based on variant IDs and do not explicitly compare retention and post-purchase engagement across variants.

**Variant:** Run app-launch paywalls as a measurable holdout experiment. Instrument all paywall, transaction, and trigger events to include experiment_id, variant_id, and paywall_id in analytics/subscription tools. Base all comparisons on variant IDs (not paywall IDs) and conduct cohort analysis of retention, refunds, plan mix, and post-purchase engagement across variants, attributing incremental lift via the holdout.

---

## Minimal, Compliant Paywall Legal Copy to Reduce Clutter

**Description:** Test simplifying paywall legal microcopy to only Apple-required elements and presenting them in a low-friction way. Replace verbose terms text with concise “Privacy Policy” and “Terms and Conditions” links (opened via in‑app browser or external), include a brief auto‑renew disclosure, and keep a Restore Purchases link. De‑emphasize legal links visually and position them out of the main conversion path. This aims to preserve real estate, reduce fear-inducing text near the CTA, and maintain review compliance.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that minimizing legal copy to only the required elements (Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, Restore Purchases) plus a concise auto‑renew disclosure, presented as de‑emphasized links away from the CTA, will increase tap‑through/purchase rates because it reduces clutter and fear‑inducing friction while preserving real estate and meeting review requirements.

**Control:** Current paywall with verbose legal/terms text and additional legal blocks placed directly under or near the primary purchase CTA; legal text is prominent within the main conversion path.

**Variant:** Paywall shows only: (1) concise links to “Privacy Policy” and “Terms and Conditions” (open via in‑app browser or external), (2) a brief auto‑renew disclosure (e.g., “Auto‑renews at $X per Y period”), and (3) a Restore Purchases link. Remove any non‑required legal microcopy. Visually deemphasize legal text (e.g., smaller text, lower opacity) and place it out of the main conversion path.

---

## Localized Priority Support SLA Callout (Top Tier)

**Description:** A/B test, in select locales where service promises resonate, adding a localized “Priority support” benefit and a premium support SLA (fast, guaranteed support) to the top-tier benefits list to assess perceived value lift and impact on upgrade rate and overall ARPU.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, in select locales where service promises resonate, localizing and calling out “Priority support” and offering fast, guaranteed support via a premium SLA in the top-tier benefits list will increase perceived value, resulting in higher upgrade rates and overall ARPU.

**Control:** In the selected locales, show the current top-tier plan without a “Priority support” callout and without a fast, guaranteed support SLA in the benefits list.

**Variant:** In the same locales, localize and add a “Priority support” bullet to the top-tier benefits list and include a premium support SLA (fast, guaranteed support).

---

## Sequenced Testing to Maximize ROI (Pricing/Packaging -> Paywall Design -> Placement/Frequency -> Personalization)

**Description:** Test whether enforcing a defined order of operations—prioritizing pricing and packaging first to establish an optimized pricing/presentation control, then paywall design, followed by placement/frequency, and finally personalization—maximizes ROI.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prioritizing pricing and packaging first, then moving to paywall design, then placement/frequency, and finally personalization will maximize ROI because it establishes an optimized pricing/presentation control before design and sequences subsequent tests accordingly.

**Control:** Begin with design-focused tests (paywall design) without first establishing an optimized pricing/presentation control.

**Variant:** Follow the defined order: (1) pricing and packaging first to establish an optimized pricing/presentation control; (2) paywall design; (3) placement and frequency; (4) personalization.

---

## Place the primary price near the CTA for clarity/compliance

**Description:** Move key pricing details adjacent to or above the CTA so they’re highly visible at the decision point.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing the primary price and key pricing details adjacent to or above the CTA will make them highly visible at the decision point, improving clarity and compliance.

**Control:** Current layout where key pricing details are not adjacent to or above the CTA.

**Variant:** Place the primary price and key pricing details adjacent to or above the CTA.

---

## Anchor Student/Educator Preferential Pricing (Same Product)

**Description:** Test whether clearly communicating a preferential student/educator rate for the same product—supported by tailored copy and social proof—improves perceived fairness and conversion versus generic pricing and messaging.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that offering students/educators a clearly labeled preferential rate for the same product, and reinforcing it with tailored copy and social proof, will increase conversion by boosting perceived fairness.

**Control:** Uniform pricing and generic messaging/social proof with no explicit "student/educator discount" callouts.

**Variant:** Offer different price points or discounts for students/educators versus professionals for the same product. Explicitly call out the "student/educator discount" and use tailored copy and social proof that communicate the preferential rate.

---

## Coaching Add‑on Upsell After Trial

**Description:** Bundle a paid coaching or concierge service as an add‑on immediately after a free trial ends. Offer a limited free trial week for the coach and use that period to upsell the paid subscription.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that presenting a coaching/concierge add‑on immediately after the free trial ends, with a limited free trial week for the coach, will result in more upsells to a paid subscription than not offering this add‑on, because that week is used to upsell the paid subscription.

**Control:** Current post‑trial experience without bundling a coaching/concierge add‑on and without a limited free trial week for the coach.

**Variant:** Immediately after the free trial ends, bundle a paid coaching or concierge service as an add‑on and offer a limited free trial week for the coach; use that week to upsell the paid subscription.

---

## Rigorous A/B Testing Protocol with Sample-Size Targets and Early Termination

**Description:** Evaluate adopting a rigorous A/B testing protocol—equal splits, QA across locales, pre-set metrics, sufficient duration and volume, and appropriate statistical validation—with explicit sample-size targets and a rule to cut low-signal tests quickly, to ensure detection of meaningful lifts (e.g., from a ~4% baseline).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that running A/B tests with equal splits, QA across locales, pre-set metrics, a sufficient duration of ~1–2 weeks and target volume of ~300–500 conversions per variant (e.g., to detect meaningful lifts from a ~4% baseline), validating results with appropriate statistical tests, and cutting tests that show no clear directional difference after ~1 week at scale will detect meaningful lifts while avoiding prolonged low-signal tests.

**Control:** Current A/B testing process without enforcing the specific protocol elements listed in the variant (no mandated equal split/QA across locales/pre-set metrics/sample-size or duration targets/early termination rule/statistical validation approach).

**Variant:** Adopt the protocol: equal splits; QA across locales; pre-set primary metrics; plan for sufficient duration (~1–2 weeks) and target volume (~300–500 conversions per variant); at ~1 week, if there is no clear directional difference at scale, end the test and move to the next hypothesis; validate outcomes using appropriate statistical tests.

---

## Avoid immediate post-dismiss discount to comply with guidelines

**Description:** Test replacing the immediate lower price shown after a decline/dismiss (which can trigger review issues) with compliant alternatives: an exit pop-up, alternate intro offers that renew at the same price, or a lifetime option.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that avoiding an immediate cheaper price after a decline/dismiss, and instead using an exit pop-up and/or alternate intro offers that renew at the same price or a lifetime option, will mitigate review issues while still providing users with alternative purchase paths.

**Control:** After a user declines/dismisses the paywall, immediately show a lower price.

**Variant:** After a user declines/dismisses the paywall, do not show an immediate lower price. Instead use one of the following: an exit pop-up; an alternate intro offer that renews at the same price; or a lifetime option.

---

## Emphasize Retention Tactics at Scale to Unlock Growth

**Description:** At higher revenue scale, elevate retention tactics—such as win‑backs—to be emphasized as much as acquisition to unlock the next stage of growth.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that, at higher revenue scale, emphasizing retention tactics (e.g., win‑backs) as much as acquisition will unlock the next stage of growth.

**Control:** Maintain current emphasis levels between acquisition and retention (i.e., retention tactics are not emphasized as much as acquisition).

**Variant:** Adjust emphasis so that retention tactics (e.g., win‑backs) are emphasized as much as acquisition at higher revenue scale.

---

## Code‑Based Discount Launch

**Description:** Test implementing centrally managed code‑based discounts to enable quick activation of an offer and assess impact, noting that reporting granularity is limited.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that centrally managed code‑based discounts will allow quick activation of an offer to test impact, despite limited reporting granularity.

**Control:** No code‑based discount mechanism in place; offers are not activated via centrally managed codes.

**Variant:** Implement centrally managed code‑based discounts and activate an offer via code to test impact, accepting limited reporting granularity.

## CTA color, size, animation (pulse), and overall color scheme test

**Description:** Experiment with CTA color, size, animation (e.g., pulse), and overall color schemes to optimize tap‑through.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that modifying CTA color, size, animation (pulse), and the overall color scheme will increase tap‑through.

**Control:** Current CTA color and size, no animation, and the existing overall color scheme.

**Variant:** CTAs using alternative color(s), adjusted size, a pulse animation, and updated overall color scheme(s).

---

## Emotional/visual nudges in the post-dismissal follow-up prompt

**Description:** Test whether adding a memorable visual or emotional cue to the post-dismissal follow-up prompt increases the likelihood that users reconsider the offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that including a memorable visual or emotional cue in the post-dismissal follow-up prompt will increase the likelihood that users reconsider the offer because such cues can nudge users to re-evaluate their decision.

**Control:** Current post-dismissal follow-up prompt without a memorable visual or emotional cue.

**Variant:** Post-dismissal follow-up prompt that includes a memorable visual or emotional cue.

---

## Dynamic CTA Copy Across Pages

**Description:** Test whether dynamic non‑numeric CTA copy, using the sibling variable for navigation index, affects final conversion. Example: on page 2 show “Start my free trial,” and on the final page show “Unlock monthly.”

**Hypothesis:** We believe that changing the CTA copy per page using the navigation index (e.g., “Start my free trial” on page 2; “Unlock monthly” on the final page) will increase final conversion.

**Control:** Current CTA copy implementation without page‑specific variation.

**Variant:** Implement dynamic non‑numeric CTA copy driven by the sibling navigation index: on page 2 display “Start my free trial,” and on the final page display “Unlock monthly.”

---

## Clean, simple, playful design to highlight value

**Description:** Test whether a minimal, colorful, fun design that makes the app feel approachable and valuable improves conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using a minimal, colorful, fun design that makes the app feel approachable and valuable will increase conversion because it highlights the app’s value and feels more approachable.

**Control:** Current app design as-is.

**Variant:** Replace the current design with a clean, simple, minimal, colorful, playful design that highlights value and makes the app feel approachable.

---

## Benefit‑Focused Motivational Push vs Generic Reminder

**Description:** A/B test push notifications that highlight specific, tangible real‑world benefits of the core behavior (e.g., health outcomes) in a motivational, non‑commercial tone versus generic reminders/nudges. Measure impact on engagement, re‑engagement, subsequent paywall clicks, and monetization/conversion likelihood.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that push notifications highlighting specific tangible, real‑world benefits of the core behavior (e.g., health outcomes) in a motivational tone will increase engagement, re‑engagement, subsequent paywall clicks, and monetization/conversion impact versus generic reminders, because they emphasize concrete benefits and feel motivational rather than purely commercial.

**Control:** Generic reminder/nudge push notifications with no concrete benefit messaging (normal).

**Variant:** Benefit‑focused, motivational push notifications that call out specific tangible, real‑world benefits of the core behavior (e.g., health outcomes) and feel motivational rather than purely commercial.

---

## Promo Push Tone Test: Direct Discount vs Clicky/Value Copy

**Description:** Test whether a marketing-forward, curiosity-inducing push tone during sale periods drives more opens and routes users to the paywall compared to clearly stating the discount. The approach should be used sparingly to preserve trust and is especially relevant when discount amounts vary by user/geo.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that during sale periods, using curiosity-driven, marketing-forward push copy—used sparingly—will increase opens and paywall visits compared to directly stating the discount, especially when discount amounts vary by user/geo.

**Control:** Push notifications during sale periods that clearly state the discount, including the specific discount amount (which may vary by user/geo).

**Variant:** Push notifications during sale periods using value- or curiosity-driven “clicky” copy that does not explicitly state the discount, intended to maximize opens and route users to the paywall, used sparingly to preserve trust.

---

## Multi-user plan naming: clarity and compliance (Family vs Team/Group/Friends & Family)

**Description:** Test whether using inclusive, non-reserved labels for a multi-user plan—when it can include non-family members—improves appeal and avoids platform review conflicts if the plan isn’t tied to platform family sharing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that replacing “Family” (a platform-reserved term when not tied to platform family sharing) with inclusive, non-reserved names like “Team,” “Group,” or “Friends & Family” will reduce mismatch, increase appeal, and prevent review issues because the names better reflect that non-family members are allowed and avoid naming conflicts.

**Control:** Plan labeled as “Family” (or similar platform-reserved family term), even though the multi-user plan can include non-family members and isn’t tied to platform family sharing.

**Variant:** Plan relabeled with non-reserved, inclusive names such as “Team,” “Group,” or “Friends & Family,” explicitly indicating the multi-user plan can include non-family members and avoiding any implication of platform family sharing.

---

## Use “AI” in higher-tier naming where appropriate

**Description:** If relevant, add “AI” and a subtle icon to higher-tier names to increase perceived capability and appeal; validate with an A/B test.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding “AI” and a subtle icon to relevant higher-tier names will increase perceived capability and appeal in an A/B test.

**Control:** Higher-tier names remain unchanged (no “AI” label or icon).

**Variant:** Add “AI” and a subtle icon to relevant higher-tier names.

---

## Avoid delayed close buttons for utility-like products

**Description:** Test whether removing the delayed close-button gimmick and emphasizing better messaging and UX alignment performs better. Delaying the appearance of the close button can be gimmicky and not effective for many product categories; instead, focus on clear messaging and aligning the experience to user expectations.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing the close action immediately and focusing on better messaging and UX alignment will be more effective than delaying the close button for utility-like products, because hiding the close action is gimmicky and not effective for many product categories.

**Control:** Experience where the close button is delayed (the close action is hidden initially).

**Variant:** Experience where the close button is visible immediately (no delay), with emphasis on better messaging and UX alignment instead of hiding the close action.

---

## Sale-branded vs generic/evergreen messaging on paywalls and in‑app messages

**Description:** Test explicitly naming the seasonal/holiday sale on paywalls and in‑app messages versus generic “limited time” or evergreen promotional messaging. A prior pure copy/skin change to “Black Friday” performed worse than a neutral “one-time offer,” so don’t assume seasonal labels lift conversion. This experiment quantifies the impact of sale-specific urgency cues on conversion and any downstream churn effects.

**Hypothesis:** Explicitly naming the seasonal sale (e.g., “Black Friday”) in time‑boxed promos on paywalls and in‑app messages will increase conversion versus generic/evergreen messaging because sale-specific labels can amplify urgency.

**Control:** Baseline generic promo design on paywalls and in‑app messages using neutral “limited time” or evergreen messaging without naming a seasonal/holiday sale (e.g., a neutral “one-time offer”).

**Variant:** Sale-branded promo on paywalls and in‑app messages that explicitly names the seasonal/holiday sale (e.g., “Black Friday”) with time‑boxed, sale-specific urgency cues.

---

## Localize full price strings (period + price)

**Description:** Don’t rely on auto-localizing just the price. Localize the entire string, including period labels like “per week” and “per month,” as these often require language-specific phrasing.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that localizing the full price string—including period labels—will produce more natural, language-appropriate phrasing because period labels often require language-specific phrasing.

**Control:** Auto-localize only the numeric price while keeping period labels generic or untranslated (e.g., “per week,” “per month” remain as-is).

**Variant:** Localize the entire price string for each language, including period labels (e.g., “per week,” “per month”), using language-specific phrasing.

---

## Gray out current plan in upgrade UI for existing subscribers

**Description:** Evaluate whether, for existing subscribers, graying out the current plan and only enabling the alternative plan—along with copy that reflects the active plan and the available upgrade/downgrade—simplifies decision-making and increases plan changes.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that graying out a subscriber’s current plan and only enabling the alternative plan, paired with copy that reflects the active plan and the available upgrade/downgrade, will simplify decision-making and increase plan changes.

**Control:** Existing upgrade UI for subscribers (no graying out of the current plan; no copy update reflecting the active plan and available upgrade/downgrade).

**Variant:** Upgrade UI where the subscriber’s current plan is grayed out, only the alternative plan is enabled, and copy reflects the active plan and the available upgrade/downgrade.

---

## Test highlighting trial length vs. weekly-equivalent price

**Description:** In plan cards, compare variants that emphasize the trial length (e.g., 3-day/7-day trial) versus weekly-equivalent pricing to understand which cue actually shifts plan choice and conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that emphasizing trial length versus weekly-equivalent pricing on plan cards will shift plan choice and conversion because the highlighted cue influences user decision-making.

**Control:** Plan cards emphasize trial length (e.g., 3-day/7-day trial) more prominently than weekly-equivalent pricing.

**Variant:** Plan cards emphasize weekly-equivalent pricing more prominently than trial length.

---

## 13‑Month Revenue Model for Pricing and Plan Tests

**Description:** Evaluate price and plan change tests using both immediate revenue and a 13‑month revenue forecast that adjusts for early cancellations via the 7‑day cancellation rate to predict longer‑term value.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that incorporating a 13‑month revenue projection adjusted by the 7‑day cancellation rate as a renewal proxy when evaluating price and plan changes will better reflect long‑term revenue than relying on immediate revenue alone.

**Control:** Judge price and plan change tests on immediate revenue only, without a 13‑month projection or adjustment for early cancellations.

**Variant:** Judge price and plan change tests on both immediate revenue and a 13‑month revenue projection that uses the 7‑day cancellation rate as a renewal proxy.

---

## Consumable IAP positioning to lift engagement and long‑term monetization

**Description:** Test whether positioning consumable, one‑off feature purchases as paid consumable experiences increases app usage and deeper engagement, and whether that correlates with higher retention and long‑term monetization/revenue.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that positioning consumable, one‑off in‑app feature purchases to drive engagement will increase subsequent app usage and deeper engagement, which will benefit retention and correlate with higher long‑term monetization/revenue.

**Control:** Current experience for consumable, one‑off feature purchases without explicit engagement‑oriented positioning; observe subsequent engagement and monetization.

**Variant:** Position consumable, one‑off feature purchases as paid consumable experiences intended to increase app usage and deeper engagement; observe subsequent engagement, retention, and long‑term monetization/revenue.

---

## Paywall text readability: bottom gradient overlay across devices and media types

**Description:** Validate that adding a bottom gradient overlay on paywall backgrounds (video or images) preserves text contrast and legibility across devices while maintaining visual impact, and compare video vs static imagery under this approach.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a bottom gradient overlay to paywall background video or images will improve text contrast and legibility across devices, preventing readability issues that hurt conversion, while preserving visual impact. With consistent contrast ensured, we can also assess whether video or static imagery performs better.

**Control:** Current paywall with text over background imagery/video without a gradient overlay, as currently implemented across devices.

**Variant:** Apply a bottom gradient overlay to the paywall background when using rich media. Run two media treatments under the overlay: background video with overlay and static imagery with overlay, to preserve text contrast and legibility across devices while comparing media types.

---

## Prioritize Most-Used Feature First to Reflect User Behavior Trends

**Description:** Reorder the feature list so the highest‑demand benefit (e.g., the most‑used import source) appears first, reflecting current user behavior trends. This tests whether surfacing the dominant option earlier impacts initial conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that moving the dominant, most‑used feature/import source to the top of the list will increase initial conversion because users immediately see their highest‑demand option.

**Control:** Current feature/feature‑bullet order, where the dominant/most‑used option is not necessarily first.

**Variant:** Reordered feature/feature‑bullet list with the highest‑demand benefit placed first (e.g., explicitly move the most‑used import source to the top).

---

## Minimum tappable sizes and typographic clarity

**Description:** Test whether enforcing a minimum button height (~64px), consistent semi-bold labels, and sufficient spacing improves readability and positively impacts metrics, given prior observations that small visual tweaks moved metrics.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that making buttons at least ~64px tall, using consistent semi-bold labels, and providing sufficient spacing will improve readability and positively move metrics because small visual tweaks have previously moved metrics.

**Control:** Current interface without an explicit ~64px minimum for button height, with existing label typography and spacing as currently implemented.

**Variant:** Interface where all buttons are at least ~64px tall, labels use a consistent semi-bold style, and spacing is adjusted to ensure readability.

---

## Paywall Social Proof: Swipeable Carousel vs Single Testimonial vs None

**Description:** Test adding concise, swipeable testimonial cards at the end of the paywall to provide social validation/social proof, and compare a carousel of short reviews to a single prominent testimonial for clarity and impact.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that ending the paywall with concise, swipeable testimonial cards will increase social validation/social proof compared to having no testimonials, and that the format (carousel of short reviews vs a single prominent testimonial) will differ in clarity and impact.

**Control:** Paywall ends without any testimonials.

**Variant:** Add a social proof section at the end of the paywall using testimonial cards:
- Variant A: Swipeable carousel of short, concise reviews (interactive).
- Variant B: Single prominent testimonial card.

---

## Accessibility fallback routing

**Description:** Detect OS-level accessibility usage on device and route those users to an accessible native paywall. Keep the fallback updated (e.g., when pricing/packaging changes).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that detecting OS-level accessibility usage and routing those users to an accessible native paywall will ensure an accessible paywall experience because the fallback is designed for accessibility and is kept current when pricing/packaging changes.

**Control:** No OS-level accessibility detection or routing; the existing paywall experience is shown.

**Variant:** Enable OS-level accessibility detection and route those users to an accessible native paywall; keep the fallback updated (e.g., when pricing/packaging changes).

---

## Insert a rating prompt before the initial paywall

**Description:** Test prompting for ratings during onboarding before the paywall to raise average ratings and reduce negative sentiment that could depress conversion later.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that prompting for ratings during onboarding before the initial paywall will raise average ratings and reduce negative sentiment that could depress conversion later.

**Control:** Onboarding shows the initial paywall without a preceding rating prompt.

**Variant:** Onboarding includes a rating prompt before the initial paywall.

---

## Localized “Made in [Country/Region]” trust badge on first-touch paywalls

**Description:** Test adding a subtle, localized provenance line (e.g., “Made in the USA” with a flag) on first-touch paywalls for users in their market, and hide it elsewhere. Prior tests have shown incremental conversion gains in some cases, while others saw no change—worth testing to assess impact on perceived relevance/quality.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing a subtle, localized “Made in [Country/Region]” badge (e.g., with a flag) to users in the corresponding locale on first-touch paywalls will increase conversion because it boosts perceived relevance/quality. Previous testing has produced incremental conversion gains, though results can vary by app.

**Control:** Current first-touch paywall without any localized provenance/trust badge shown to users across locales.

**Variant:** First-touch paywall includes a subtle, localized provenance line (e.g., “Made in [Country/Region]” with a flag) for users in that specific locale and is hidden for users outside their matching locale.

---

## Deep link a retention offer from the app icon long-press menu

**Description:** Test adding an app shortcut labeled “Wait—special offer” to the app icon long-press menu that deep links to a save offer paywall, leveraging the fact that this menu is often used before uninstall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a “Wait—special offer” shortcut in the app icon long-press menu that deep links to a save offer paywall will increase engagement with the save offer because users often access this menu before uninstall.

**Control:** Current app icon long-press menu without a shortcut to a save offer paywall.

**Variant:** Add an app shortcut labeled “Wait—special offer” to the app icon long-press menu that deep links directly to the save offer paywall.

---

## Checkmarked benefit bullets above the CTA

**Description:** Test whether placing 1–2 concise checkmarked benefits immediately above the button, with adequate spacing, reinforces value and helps focus the user on the action.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding 1–2 concise checkmarked benefits immediately above the button (with adequate spacing) will reinforce value and help focus users on the action compared to not including these benefits.

**Control:** Button displayed without checkmarked benefit bullets immediately above it.

**Variant:** Button preceded by 1–2 concise checkmarked benefit bullets placed immediately above it with adequate spacing.

---

## Make low‑value cohorts free to unlock virality

**Description:** Test removing the hard paywall for cohorts with negligible revenue to drive goodwill, positive ratings, and referral/viral effects instead of forcing a poor‑value conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the hard paywall for negligible‑revenue cohorts will increase goodwill, positive ratings, and referral/viral effects compared to forcing a poor‑value conversion.

**Control:** Maintain the hard paywall for all cohorts, including those with negligible revenue, requiring conversion to proceed.

**Variant:** Remove the hard paywall for cohorts with negligible revenue, making access free to drive goodwill, positive ratings, and referral/viral effects rather than forcing a poor‑value conversion.

---

## Experiment: smallest-period price display

**Description:** Test displaying prices in the smallest available period versus standard period display.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that displaying prices in the smallest available period will produce a different outcome compared to the standard period display.

**Control:** Prices are displayed using the standard period.

**Variant:** Prices are displayed using the smallest available period.

---

## Replace paywall auto-scroll with a subtle bottom shadow/gradient to signal scroll

**Description:** Test replacing auto-scrolling paywall content with a clear scroll affordance—a faint bottom shadow/gradient—so users discover additional content below the fold and engage more with benefits lists. This matters because auto-scrolling performed poorly; on some devices there was no additional content beyond the fold, which confused users. Instead of auto-scroll, use visual cues (shadows, partial peeks, arrows) to signal more content.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a subtle bottom shadow/gradient to signal more content—rather than auto-scrolling—will help users discover content below the fold and increase engagement with benefits lists because auto-scroll confused users, especially on devices that showed no additional content beyond the fold.

**Control:** Paywall content auto-scrolls.

**Variant:** Auto-scroll is removed. A subtle bottom shadow/gradient is added at the bottom of the paywall to signal that more content is available below the fold.

---

## Portrait-only vs responsive orientation for paywalls

**Description:** Test whether enforcing portrait orientation on paywalls where landscape layouts degrade presentation (e.g., with new vertical packaging) improves readability/legibility, CTA visibility, and conversion compared to allowing responsive orientation.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that enforcing portrait orientation for paywalls where landscape layouts degrade presentation (e.g., new vertical packaging) will improve readability/legibility, increase CTA visibility, and improve conversion compared to responsive orientation, because landscape harms legibility or conversion in these cases.

**Control:** Current responsive orientation: paywalls render in both portrait and landscape, including layouts that may degrade presentation in landscape.

**Variant:** Lock the paywall to portrait orientation for the identified paywalls (e.g., those using new vertical packaging) so the experience is portrait-only.

---

## Use English-only audiences for speed, then localize winners

**Description:** Filter test audiences by language (e.g., device/preferred language code) to iterate quickly in one language. After a winner is found, localize and roll out to other markets.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using an English-only audience (via device/preferred language code) will let us iterate more quickly to find a winner, then localizing the winner will enable rollout to other markets.

**Control:** Tests run across mixed-language audiences without language filtering.

**Variant:** Filter test audiences to English-only using device/preferred language code; run experiments in one language to identify a winner, then localize and roll out the winner to other markets.

---

## Limit Concurrent Variants to Deepen Cohorts and Speed Learning

**Description:** Test whether running fewer, deeper variants per test—and layering hypothesis types—improves time-to-significance and learning versus running many variants concurrently. This matters because splitting traffic too thin can delay maturity, especially for trial-to-paid outcomes that take weeks to resolve.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that limiting to 3–4 variants per test (expanding to 4 variants plus control as traffic scales), focusing on the highest‑leverage hypotheses and layering tests (copy vs layout), will reduce time‑to‑significance, speed learning, and protect power compared to running ~6 concurrent variants and spreading traffic across lower‑priority ideas (e.g., delayed‑X).

**Control:** Run ~6 variants in a single test window to reach significance within ~2 weeks at typical volumes, potentially mixing hypothesis types (e.g., hard vs soft, price tiers, trial length, exit offer type, delayed‑X) in the same window.

**Variant:** Prefer 3–4 variants per test to keep cohorts deep and avoid splitting audiences so thin that each variant takes weeks to mature; when volume is limited, trim variants (skip delayed‑X) and focus on highest‑leverage hypotheses (hard vs soft, price tiers, trial length, exit offer type); layer tests by hypothesis type (copy vs layout) to parallelize learnings; as traffic scales, expand to 4 variants plus control; prioritize speed to learning and protect power.

---

## Visually separate paywall sections with whitespace and clear grouping

**Description:** Test whether separating paywall sections (timelines, features, CTAs) using spacing, dividers, and contrast helps each section read distinctly and reduces cognitive load compared to a dense layout where elements run together.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that visually separating paywall sections with whitespace, dividers, and contrast will make each section read distinctly and reduce cognitive load compared to a dense layout where timelines, features, and CTAs run together.

**Control:** Current paywall layout with dense blocks where timelines, features, and CTAs run together, offering little visual separation between sections.

**Variant:** Apply clear grouping with additional whitespace, dividers, and contrast to visually separate timelines, features, and CTAs so each section reads distinctly.

---

## Risk‑weighted traffic splits with holdout size sensitivity for high‑impact changes

**Description:** Test how pairing control‑heavy, uneven variant allocations with explicit holdouts balances learning speed and business risk when running high‑impact changes (e.g., aggressive pricing or no‑exit variants). This combines control‑weighted exposure (e.g., 70% control with small shares to risky variants, or 80/20–70/30) and different holdout sizes (10% vs 50%) so a portion of users remains unaffected.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using control‑heavy traffic splits together with a holdout will mitigate downside risk while we validate impact. A larger holdout (50%) will further limit business risk but slow learning relative to a smaller holdout (10%); a smaller holdout may be sufficient when paired with uneven allocations (e.g., 70/30 or 80/20).

**Control:** Apply a small holdout: 10% of total traffic receives no change. Allocate the remaining 90% unevenly to limit downside—for example, keep most traffic in control (e.g., 70%) and assign small shares to risky variants (e.g., 10% each). If testing a single risky change, use an uneven split such as 80/20 or 70/30.

**Variant:** Increase the holdout to 50% (users remain unaffected). Keep the same control‑heavy, risk‑weighted allocation among exposed traffic as in the control—for example, majority to control (e.g., 70%) with small shares to risky variants (e.g., 10% each), or 80/20–70/30 if a single risky change—so the only change is holdout size.

---

## Single-placement Lottie animation on paywalls (hero visual or CTA background)

**Description:** Test adding a lightweight Lottie animation to a single paywall element to increase perceived quality, storytelling, and attention, while minimizing load-time risk. Run as a controlled A/B within one feature-gate to quantify impact without broad exposure.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a lightweight Lottie animation to either the hero visual (e.g., an explanatory slider) or behind the primary CTA text (as a subtle looping background) will increase perceived quality and storytelling and draw attention, producing measurable impact without broadly risking load time.

**Control:** Current paywall with a static hero visual and a standard primary CTA; no Lottie animations.

**Variant:** Paywall shows exactly one lightweight Lottie animation, enabled via a single feature-gate: either the hero visual uses an explanatory slider Lottie to enhance perceived quality/storytelling, or the primary CTA has a subtle looping Lottie background behind the text to draw attention, without changing button copy or layout. Only one placement is active at a time, and the test runs as a controlled A/B in one feature-gate to limit load-time risk.

---

## Net-new conversion attribution by placement to detect paywall cannibalization

**Description:** Use charts that attribute net-new conversions by placement to evaluate whether a new paywall is cannibalizing purchases from other entry points.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that attributing net-new conversions by placement will reveal whether a new paywall is cannibalizing purchases from other entry points.

**Control:** Purchases from existing entry points without the new paywall.

**Variant:** Introduce the new paywall and use charts that attribute net-new conversions by placement to compare against control and identify any cannibalization.

---

## Geo/Device/Age Exclusion Rules Segmentation Test

**Description:** Test separate geo-, device-, and age-based exclusion rules to identify which segmentation driver most effectively reduces cannibalization with minimal conversion loss.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that applying exclusion rules by geo, device, or age will reduce cannibalization with minimal conversion loss, and that running these as separate tests will reveal which segmentation driver is most effective.

**Control:** No geo-, device-, or age-based exclusion rules are applied.

**Variant:** Apply exclusion rules separately by geo, device, and age (run as separate experiments) to measure each segmentation driver’s impact on cannibalization and conversion.

---

## Visual Discount Banner Test

**Description:** Test whether showing an extra “10% off” discount banner, while keeping the same base price, increases conversion by visually emphasizing the discount.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding an extra “10% off” banner without changing the base price will increase conversion because the visual emphasis of the discount drives higher conversion.

**Control:** Current experience with the base price displayed and no extra “10% off” discount banner.

**Variant:** Display an additional banner stating “10% off” alongside the unchanged base price.

---

## Restore Purchases copy and placement test

**Description:** Evaluate renaming “Restore” to “Already purchased?” and changing its placement from a small footer link to a clearly visible top‑area element (often top‑right near the close button). This test quantifies changes in support tickets (including from users who reinstalled or changed devices) and negative reviews, while balancing trust, conversion, and distraction from the main CTA. It also ensures a restore option is always present to reduce platform review issues and align with store guidelines and user expectations.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing a clearly visible “Already purchased?” entry point near the top (often top‑right, near the close button) will reduce support tickets and negative reviews and help meet store guidelines and user expectations, while a smaller footer “Restore” link will better maintain trust and minimally affect conversion; testing these will quantify the trade‑off without distracting from the main CTA.

**Control:** Always include a restore option as a small footer link labeled “Restore.” This low‑prominence presentation is intended to avoid distracting from the main CTA and is hypothesized to maintain trust while minimally affecting conversion.

**Variant:** Rename the entry point to “Already purchased?” and place it prominently near the top area (often top‑right, near the close button), presented as a clearly visible element (e.g., a more visible button). This aims to reduce support tickets (especially from users who have reinstalled or changed devices) and negative reviews, and to meet store guidelines and user expectations.

---

## View all plans: label and final-page placement

**Description:** Test how the wording and placement of a “view all plans” element affects transparency, trust, and conversion. Compare placing the access in the header versus adding a small link under the primary CTA on the final/purchase page (after plan selection) to provide alternate options without cluttering earlier steps. Includes copy test of “See plans” vs. “View all plans.” If the X fully closes the paywall, show the element on the purchase page.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that placing a small “view all plans” element beneath the primary CTA on the final purchase page (after the user selects a plan), and using the clearest label (“See plans” or “View all plans”), will provide a sense of transparency and control, improving trust and conversion while preserving primary CTA conversion, because it offers access to alternate options in a clearer, less intrusive location than the header and avoids clutter in earlier steps.

**Control:** Access to plans located in the header (link), using existing approach (e.g., “See plans”).

**Variant:** If the X fully closes the paywall, add a small “View all plans” element beneath the primary CTA on the final/purchase page after the user selects a plan to provide access to alternate options without cluttering earlier steps; also test the link label copy (“See plans” vs. “View all plans”).

---

## Remove low-usage 'View all plans' link from the paywall

**Description:** Test eliminating the low-usage 'View all plans' entry point on the paywall to reduce distraction and cognitive load, thereby streamlining decision-making. Measure impact to confirm it’s a low-value element.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing a low-usage 'View all plans' link from the paywall will reduce distraction and cognitive load, thereby streamlining decision-making.

**Control:** Current paywall with the 'View all plans' link/entry point visible.

**Variant:** Paywall with the 'View all plans' link/entry point removed.

---

## Discount method trade-offs: Offer codes vs discounted SKUs

**Description:** Test replacing discounted SKUs with offer codes to avoid SKU-related pitfalls. Offer codes lack reporting; discounted SKUs can cause subscription-group visibility issues, double billing, or trial eligibility conflicts. Introductory offers are noted but excluded because they can be mutually exclusive with trials on some platforms.

**Hypothesis:** We believe replacing discounted SKUs with offer codes will reduce subscription-group visibility issues, double billing, and trial eligibility conflicts because these issues are associated with discounted SKUs, acknowledging that offer codes lack reporting.

**Control:** Discounts delivered via discounted SKUs. Known risks include subscription-group visibility issues, potential double billing, and trial eligibility conflicts.

**Variant:** Deliver the same discounts via offer codes instead of discounted SKUs. Accept that offer codes lack reporting. Do not include introductory offers, as they can be mutually exclusive with trials on some platforms.

---

## Redeem X Days for $Y CTA vs Standard Discount CTA

**Description:** A/B test whether framing cheaper, discounted, or special offers with a "Redeem X days for $Y" call-to-action increases click-through compared to a standard discount CTA by emphasizing limited-time redemption and concrete value.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using "Redeem X days for $Y" for cheaper, discounted, or special offers will increase click-through compared to a standard discount CTA because it frames the deal as a limited-time redemption and highlights concrete value.

**Control:** Current standard discount CTA wording.

**Variant:** Replace the CTA with "Redeem X days for $Y" for cheaper, discounted, or special offers, framing the deal as a limited-time redemption and highlighting concrete value.

---

## Explicit “No thanks” exit language; “X” closes modal only

**Description:** Test using explicit “No thanks” copy for exits on pop-ups, exit offers, and alternate offers, and making the “X” act only as a modal close. This aims to reduce accidental dismissals, clarify choices, keep the experience honest, and improve user trust.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that requiring an affirmative “No thanks” to dismiss an exit offer, while the “X” simply closes the modal, and using explicit exit copy instead of vague labels will reduce accidental dismissals, clarify choices, and improve user trust because the exit language is clear and explicit.

**Control:** Pop-ups, exit offers, and alternate offers use vague or non-explicit exit labels, and users can dismiss without an explicit “No thanks” (e.g., by clicking the “X”).

**Variant:** All pop-ups, exit offers, and alternate offers present explicit exit copy like “No thanks.” For exit offers specifically, dismissal requires clicking “No thanks,” while the “X” only closes the modal without making a choice.

---

## Local trial-end reminder vs timeline-only

**Description:** Test whether adding a local notification reminder before trial end improves outcomes compared to showing only a trial timeline. After purchase, prompt for notification permission and, if granted, schedule a local reminder (e.g., Day 5 of a 7-day trial) using friendly copy like “No action needed if you’re enjoying it.” This aims to reassure users at signup and reduce early cancellations. Note: a mid-trial server push reminder (e.g., Day 4) is a separate idea intended to be tested separately; the current test isolates the incremental effect of adding a reminder to the timeline.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding a local reminder before trial end (e.g., Day 5 of a 7-day trial) with reassuring copy will reduce early cancellations versus timeline-only, because it proactively reminds users of trial status and sets expectations while signaling that no action is needed if they’re enjoying the product.

**Control:** Timeline-only: no scheduled reminder notifications (no local or push trial reminders).

**Variant:** Timeline + local reminder: after purchase, prompt for notification permission; if granted, schedule a local notification before trial end (e.g., Day 5 of a 7-day trial) with copy such as “No action needed if you’re enjoying it.” The mid-trial push (e.g., Day 4) is not included in this variant and should be tested separately.

## Show “What’s New” on Win-Backs for Product-Fit Cancels

**Description:** Target users who canceled due to product fit with a win-back paywall that highlights recently shipped features addressing common objections, rather than relying only on price incentives.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that highlighting recently shipped features that address common objections on win-back paywalls for product-fit cancels will outperform using only price incentives because it directly addresses the reasons they canceled.

**Control:** Win-back paywall that uses only price incentives.

**Variant:** Win-back paywall that highlights recently shipped features addressing common objections ("what’s new") instead of only price incentives.

---

## Filter exit-offer logic by originating placement

**Description:** Test filtering paywall-decline handling on the original presented-by placement so exit offers only trigger where intended (e.g., onboarding) and not from unrelated screens.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that filtering exit-offer logic by the original presented-by placement will ensure exit offers only trigger where intended (e.g., onboarding) and not from unrelated screens.

**Control:** Exit offers trigger on paywall decline without filtering by originating placement; they can fire from unrelated screens.

**Variant:** Exit offers trigger on paywall decline only when the original presented-by placement matches intended contexts (e.g., onboarding); declines from unrelated screens do not trigger exit offers.

---

## Align paywall trial messaging with plan selection and timeline promises

**Description:** Test whether aligning trial indicators and plan availability reduces conflicting messages, review issues, and mismatched expectations by adjusting what users see based on selected plan type and the presence of a promised timeline.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that dynamically replacing trial badges when a one-time (lifetime) plan is selected and removing short-trial plans from variants that promise a timeline will avoid conflicting messages, review issues, and mismatched expectations.

**Control:** Paywall shows trial badges such as “3 days free” regardless of plan selection (including when a one-time/lifetime plan is chosen) and includes short-trial plans even in variants that include a timeline that promises notifications.

**Variant:** When a user selects a one-time/lifetime plan, replace trial badges like “3 days free” with a generic value header such as “Special offer.” If a paywall variant includes a timeline that promises notifications, remove short-trial plans from that variant.

---

## Speed App Store Approvals with Exact-Dimension Screenshots, Reviewer Notes, and Paywall Screenshot Reuse

**Description:** Test whether providing exact-dimension (precise-size) screenshots, reusing an existing paywall screenshot for new in-app products, and adding reviewer notes that explain products are for price/paywall testing speeds App Store approvals and reduces friction when adding many new products (including prices/trials).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that including exact-dimension screenshots, reusing an existing paywall screenshot for new in-app products, and adding a reviewer note explaining that the new products (prices/trials) are for price/paywall testing will speed approvals and reduce friction when adding many variants because reviewers have clear context and the required imagery up front.

**Control:** Submit new in-app/subscription products without exact-dimension screenshots and without a reviewer note explaining price/paywall testing; do not reuse an existing paywall screenshot.

**Variant:** For all new products (including subscription and price/trial variants): provide exact-dimension (precise-size) screenshots; reuse an existing paywall screenshot for new in-app products; add a reviewer note explicitly stating the products are for price/paywall testing.

---

## Dark-mode specific styling tests

**Description:** Test font, contrast, and accent color adjustments unique to dark mode to improve readability and increase conversion on devices set to dark.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adjusting font, contrast, and accent colors specifically for dark mode will increase conversion on devices set to dark because it improves readability.

**Control:** Existing dark mode styling with current font, contrast, and accent colors.

**Variant:** Dark mode with adjusted font, contrast, and accent colors aimed at improving readability.

---

## Stakeholder On-Device Paywall Preview via QR/Deep Link with Simulation and Debug Audience

**Description:** Test whether enabling scannable QR or deep-link previews—augmented with simulated trial eligibility and locale toggles—and a temporary debug audience filtered by app user ID helps non-developers (design, PM, growth) QA specific paywalls on device faster, catch small-screen issues pre-release, and reduce build loops.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that providing QR/deep-link paywall previews on device, with the ability to toggle simulated trial eligibility and locale, plus a temporary debug audience filtered by a specific app user ID (with assignments reset when switching variants), will dramatically speed design QA, reduce build loops, and help stakeholders catch small-screen issues pre-release.

**Control:** Current QA flow without QR/deep-link paywall previews; stakeholders rely on developer builds to view paywalls; no on-device simulation of trial eligibility or locale; no temporary debug audience; switching variants can result in sticky assignment.

**Variant:** Enable a preview system where non-developers can open a specific paywall on device via scannable QR code or deep link; include toggles to simulate trial eligibility and locale; create a temporary debug audience filtered by a specific app user ID to preview a variant; ensure assignments are reset when switching variants to avoid sticky assignment issues.

---

## Always-on vs Eligibility-Gated Free-Trial Messaging

**Description:** Test whether showing free-trial messaging to everyone versus only eligible users changes conversion or cancellations. Prior tests found negligible differences between conditional and always-on copy; if differences remain minimal, simplifying this logic may reduce implementation complexity without hurting conversion.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that showing free-trial messaging to everyone will not materially change conversion or cancellations compared to conditioning the copy on eligibility, because prior observed tests showed little to no difference.

**Control:** Free-trial messaging is shown only to eligible users (eligibility-gated copy).

**Variant:** Free-trial messaging is shown to all users regardless of eligibility (always-on copy).

---

## Equal‑sample methodology vs uneven splits

**Description:** Test equal‑sized sample comparisons against uneven traffic splits to understand how variance and decision speed affect outcomes for this traffic profile and to avoid skewed confidence intervals. This includes comparing 50/50 short tests and a 70/10/10 allocation that uses a 10% mini‑control for apples‑to‑apples analysis.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using equal‑sized sample comparisons—either 50/50 short tests read after the refund window or a 70/10/10 allocation with a 10% mini‑control comparing only the 10% cells—will yield cleaner apples‑to‑apples results with less skewed confidence intervals than uneven splits (e.g., 80/20 or 70/10/10 analyzed on full allocations).

**Control:** Uneven split allocation (e.g., 80/20 or 70/10/10) where outcomes are compared using the full, unequal group sizes from each allocation.

**Variant:** Equal‑sample comparisons implemented via either: (1) 50/50 short tests run for a few days, then turned off and read after the refund window; or (2) 70% main control, 10% mini‑control, 10% variant, analyzing only the 10% vs 10% cells for apples‑to‑apples results.

---

## Gate high-variance web checkout tests by storefront and app version

**Description:** When testing risky/high-variance flows (e.g., web checkout), filter by storefront country and set a minimum app version to keep scope tight, control exposure, and produce cleaner data for analysis (e.g., US-only and app version ≥ X).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that gating web checkout tests by specific storefronts (e.g., US-only) and a minimum app version (≥ X) will keep scope tight, control exposure, and result in cleaner, lower-variance data than testing across all storefronts and versions.

**Control:** Web checkout test runs without storefront or app version filters; all storefronts and app versions are included.

**Variant:** Web checkout test is limited by storefront country (e.g., US-only) and requires a minimum app version (≥ X).

---

## Attribute plan-selection actions with custom events

**Description:** Add custom analytics events when users select monthly or annual, tap redeem code, or open “view all plans,” enabling deeper funnel analysis (e.g., differentiating curious vs. decisive users).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that firing custom analytics events for monthly/annual selection, redeem code taps, and “view all plans” opens will enable deeper funnel analysis that distinguishes curious versus decisive users.

**Control:** Existing analytics without dedicated custom events for these specific plan-selection interactions.

**Variant:** Implement custom events that fire when users select monthly vs. annual, tap redeem code, or open “view all plans.”

---

## Centralized Experiment Board + Paywall Change Log with Unique IDs

**Description:** Test whether instituting a centralized experiment board and change log that documents every paywall update, assigns unique IDs to experiments, and shares outcomes with stakeholders improves the ability to contextualize performance shifts, guide next experiments, and align rollouts.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that assigning unique IDs to experiments, maintaining a centralized board and change log that documents every paywall update, and sharing outcomes with stakeholders will better contextualize future performance shifts, guide next experiments, and align rollouts because the change log is used to contextualize performance and shared outcomes align rollouts.

**Control:** Current process without a centralized experiment board and change log: no system that documents every paywall update with unique experiment IDs; outcomes not consistently shared with stakeholders for rollout alignment.

**Variant:** Introduce a centralized experiment board and change log: document every paywall update; assign unique IDs to experiments; maintain and share outcomes with stakeholders to align rollouts; reference the change log to contextualize performance shifts and guide next experiments.

---

## Run tests for at least one full week

**Description:** Evaluate whether keeping experiments live for at least one week improves decision-making by capturing weekday vs weekend behavior and shrinking confidence intervals before acting on results.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that keeping experiments live for at least one week will capture weekday vs weekend behavior and result in narrower confidence intervals before acting on results.

**Control:** No minimum duration: experiments may be concluded before a full week has elapsed.

**Variant:** Minimum one-week duration: keep experiments live for at least 7 consecutive days before acting on results.

---

## Weigh virality trade‑offs quantitatively

**Description:** When removing or tightening share access, discount expected revenue uplift by 10–15% (or by the measured share‑attribution rate) to approximate lost virality and evaluate net impact.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that discounting expected revenue uplift by 10–15% (or by the measured share‑attribution rate) when removing or tightening share access will account for lost virality and yield a net impact estimate that reflects this trade‑off.

**Control:** Evaluate expected revenue uplift from removing or tightening share access without any discount for lost virality.

**Variant:** Evaluate expected revenue uplift from removing or tightening share access after discounting by 10–15% (or by the measured share‑attribution rate) to approximate lost virality.

---

## A/A Paywall Parity Test: Legacy Native vs Rebuilt No‑Code/Builder Platform

**Description:** Rebuild the existing native paywall in a no‑code/builder platform (e.g., Superwall), duplicating the design across iOS, Android, and web in a single action. Split traffic between the legacy native implementation and the rebuilt version via remote config, feature flag, or user property—either directly at 50/50 or by gradually ramping 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% with an instant kill switch. Run a short A/A test (2–3 days or up to a week) to validate pixel/UI parity (fonts, spacing, font sizes, gradients, copy, CTAs, trials), technical correctness, and identical behavior in tracking/instrumentation, attribution, eligibility logic, paywall exposure, UA postbacks, and key outcomes (conversion, transactions, revenue). This creates a clean benchmark, catches integration drift, and de‑risks migration before any A/B experiments or full rollout.

**Hypothesis:** We believe the rebuilt paywall shown via the new builder/no‑code system will produce no statistically significant difference in conversion, transactions, and revenue versus the legacy native paywall (i.e., remain within normal variance) because the design, eligibility logic, and instrumentation are identical. Validating this parity will confirm technical correctness and allow a confident ramp to 100% and reliable baselines for future experiments.

**Control:** Legacy native paywall implementation using the current framework/SDK with existing rendering and instrumentation, shown to its share of traffic. Tracking, attribution, eligibility logic, paywall exposure, and UA postbacks operate as they do today.

**Variant:** Rebuilt paywall in the new system (no‑code/builder platform, e.g., Superwall) that clones the current design and offers, duplicated across iOS, Android, and web. Route users via remote config/feature flag/user property to achieve a 50/50 A/A split, optionally ramping 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% with the ability to instantly turn off and flip back. Validate pixel/UI parity (fonts, spacing, font sizes, gradients, copy, CTAs, trials), technical correctness, and parity across tracking/instrumentation, attribution, eligibility logic, paywall exposure, UA postbacks, and outcomes (conversion, transactions, revenue) over 2–3 days or up to a week. If parity holds within normal variance (no statistically significant differences), proceed to ramp to 100% or begin subsequent A/B tests.

---

## Check stability with weekly/monthly proceeds views before declaring winners

**Description:** Test using weekly and monthly proceeds views to ensure results aren’t driven by volatility before declaring winners, especially for packaging tests.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that reviewing weekly/monthly proceeds views before declaring winners will prevent volatility-driven conclusions, especially for packaging tests, because it ensures results aren’t driven by volatility.

**Control:** Declare winners without reviewing weekly or monthly proceeds views for stability.

**Variant:** Require reviewing weekly/monthly proceeds views to confirm stability before declaring winners, with particular focus on packaging tests.

---

## Keep abandonment timers optional

**Description:** Test whether showing a countdown timer in abandonment down-sell flows impacts performance. Previous tests showed no meaningful difference between timer vs. no timer. The goal is to prioritize clarity of the down-sell offer and only use a timer when a true time-bounded discount is enforced.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that removing the countdown timer in abandonment flows without a truly time-bounded discount will perform the same as showing a timer because prior tests showed no meaningful difference. Making timers optional helps prioritize clarity of the down-sell offer.

**Control:** Abandonment down-sell displays a countdown timer.

**Variant:** Abandonment down-sell does not display a countdown timer; a timer is only included when a true time-bounded discount is enforced.

---

## Exclude re‑subscribers and reinstalls from new‑user analyses via first‑install attribute

**Description:** Test whether storing a first‑install/created‑date attribute (ISO format) and using it to separate re‑subscribes and reinstalls from true new users produces cleaner conversion and LTV metrics, especially when users churn and re‑subscribe around workload cycles.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that filtering to true new users using a first‑install/created‑date attribute will avoid skewing conversion and LTV metrics by excluding reinstalls and re‑subscribes that occur around workload cycles.

**Control:** New‑user analyses and experiments include re‑subscribes and reinstalls; no first‑install/created‑date attribute is used to filter audiences, so new conversions and re‑subscribes are combined.

**Variant:** Store a first‑install/created‑date attribute (ISO format) and filter audiences to target true new users, explicitly separating new conversions from re‑subscribes and excluding reinstalls when needed for clean new‑user experiments.

---

## RICE Prioritization with Weekly Research and Cross‑Functional Pipeline

**Description:** Test adopting RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize the experiment backlog—emphasizing high reach/impact and minimized effort—while instituting a weekly research habit and involving cross‑functional teams to keep a full pipeline.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that using RICE scoring to prioritize experiments, focusing on high Reach and Impact while minimizing Effort, combined with a weekly research habit and cross‑functional involvement, will produce a well‑prioritized backlog and maintain a full pipeline of ideas because it systematically scores by Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort and ensures ongoing, cross‑functional input.

**Control:** Current prioritization and backlog maintenance without the explicit RICE framework, weekly research habit, or deliberate cross‑functional involvement to maintain the pipeline.

**Variant:** Implement RICE scoring for all backlog ideas (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), prioritize those with higher Reach/Impact and lower Effort, make research a weekly habit, and involve cross‑functional teams to maintain a full backlog/pipeline.

---

## Iconography + Color‑Coded/Colorized Headings + Generous Spacing for Long Lists

**Description:** Test whether visually enhancing long benefit/bullet lists with icons, color‑coded/colorized titles/headings, and generous spacing improves how easily users can process the content.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding iconography, color‑coded/colorized titles/headings, and generous spacing to long benefit/bullet lists will make them more scannable, readable, and engaging because these visual cues help users parse information quickly.

**Control:** Current long benefit/bullet lists presented without iconography, with plain (non‑colorized) titles/headings, and standard/tighter spacing.

**Variant:** Long benefit/bullet lists that include iconography for items, color‑coded/colorized titles/headings, and generous/ample spacing between items and sections to aid scanning.

---

## Android subscriptions: explicit offer IDs vs auto-selection within base plans

**Description:** Test applying promotions in Android subscriptions by either explicitly specifying base plan and offer IDs or allowing auto-selection of the best eligible offer.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that allowing auto-selection will apply the best eligible offer without manual ID selection, while explicit selection is needed when a specific offer must be enforced.

**Control:** Promotions use explicitly specified base plan and offer IDs within Android subscription base plans.

**Variant:** Promotions allow auto-selection of the best eligible offer within Android subscription base plans.

---

## Paywall pre-flight guardrails: 100% control rollout → AA parity → brand-alignment A/B

**Description:** Before running big paywall changes or switching frameworks/designs, briefly ship the current paywall to 100% of users for a few days to verify analytics and stability. Then run an AA parity test, followed by a light “brand alignment” A/B as a do‑no‑harm check. This sequence protects data quality, reduces false conclusions, and establishes a safe control before testing bigger concept changes (e.g., multi‑page).

**Hypothesis:** We believe that briefly rolling out the current paywall to 100% to verify analytics and stability, followed by an AA parity test, will validate measurement integrity; and that a light “brand alignment” paywall variant will perform at parity (do‑no‑harm) versus the current paywall. This will protect data quality and reduce false conclusions, enabling confident follow‑on tests of larger concept changes.

**Control:** Current paywall experience. Pre-step: ship the current paywall to 100% of users for a few days to verify analytics and stability. AA phase: both buckets receive the identical current paywall (parity). Guardrail A/B phase: control remains the current paywall.

**Variant:** Guardrail A/B phase: a light “brand alignment” version of the paywall aligned to the new framework/design, used as a do‑no‑harm check after the AA parity test passes.

---

## Reset experiment data when reconfiguring tests

**Description:** Test whether resetting experiment data upon test reconfiguration (e.g., swapping products, redesigning flows, changing exit rules) avoids contaminated reads and ensures clean comparisons.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that resetting experiment data when swapping products, redesigning flows, or changing exit rules will avoid contaminated reads and ensure clean comparisons.

**Control:** Do not reset experiment data when tests are reconfigured; continue accumulating data across changes.

**Variant:** Reset experiment data whenever tests are reconfigured (including when swapping products, redesigning flows, or changing exit rules) before continuing data collection.

---

## Sustain High Experiment Velocity

**Description:** Test whether maintaining a steady cadence of prioritized, well‑designed experiments increases monetization, given the observed correlation between fast testing cycles and monetization gains.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sustaining a high experiment velocity—by maintaining a steady cadence of prioritized, well‑designed experiments—will increase monetization gains because fast testing cycles have correlated with higher monetization.

**Control:** Current testing cadence without changes.

**Variant:** Maintain a steady cadence of prioritized, well‑designed experiments to sustain high experiment velocity.

---

## Platform‑Specific Styling Partitioning

**Description:** Test creating a single paywall that works for both iOS and Android while maintaining separate style files (e.g., colors, fonts) so each platform can be updated independently without rewriting the entire layout.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that keeping a shared paywall layout with platform‑specific style files will allow iOS and Android to be updated independently without rewriting the entire layout.

**Control:** A single paywall for iOS and Android that uses shared, unified style files (e.g., colors, fonts) across both platforms.

**Variant:** A single paywall for iOS and Android that keeps the layout shared but uses separate platform‑specific style files (e.g., colors, fonts) so each platform can be updated independently without rewriting the layout.

---

## Post-cancel push-linked survey vs. in-paywall dialog under hard paywall

**Description:** Test collecting qualitative cancellation reasons via a push-linked survey sent after trial cancellation instead of using in-paywall dialogs that can’t close cleanly, to avoid blocking within a hard paywall.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that sending a push-linked survey after a trial cancel will gather qualitative reasons without blocking and will avoid the close issues seen with in-paywall dialogs under a hard paywall.

**Control:** Users encounter in-paywall dialogs within the hard paywall asking for cancellation reasons; these dialogs cannot be closed cleanly.

**Variant:** After a trial cancellation, users receive a push notification linking to a survey to collect qualitative cancellation reasons, with no in-paywall dialog or blocking within the hard paywall.

---

## Always carry the previous winner forward as control

**Description:** Include the prior winning variant in subsequent tests to control for seasonal/demand changes and to preserve a clean baseline in the same date range.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that carrying the prior winning variant forward as the control in subsequent tests will better control for seasonal/demand changes and preserve a clean baseline within the same date range.

**Control:** Subsequent tests do not include the prior winning variant as the control.

**Variant:** Subsequent tests include the prior winning variant as the control in the same date range.

---

## Strict Naming Conventions and No Mid‑Experiment Paywall Renames

**Description:** Test whether enforcing consistent, descriptive names for campaigns, audiences, and paywalls (e.g., “Test 1 – Q4 Pricing – V2”) and prohibiting renaming active paywalls simplifies analysis, supports long‑term comparisons, and avoids data integrity and attribution issues across placements and campaigns.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that consistent, descriptive naming and a no‑rename policy for active paywalls (duplicate instead, then pause and archive) will simplify analysis and long‑term comparisons and prevent data integrity and attribution issues because analysts often key off paywall names in analytics and renaming active variants creates attribution issues across placements and campaigns.

**Control:** Current practice: names are not consistently descriptive across campaigns, audiences, and paywalls, and active paywalls may be renamed mid‑experiment, which can complicate analysis and create data integrity and attribution issues across placements and campaigns.

**Variant:** Adopt a strict naming convention across campaigns, audiences, and paywalls (e.g., “Test 1 – Q4 Pricing – V2”); do not rename paywalls mid‑experiment; when changes are needed, duplicate the paywall, then pause and archive the prior version.

---

## Keep toggle semantics consistent between main paywall and plan drawer

**Description:** Test whether mirroring the main paywall’s Tier A/Tier B toggle orientation and logic inside the “View all plans” drawer reduces cognitive friction and drop‑offs.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that mirroring the main paywall’s Tier A/Tier B toggle orientation and logic inside the “View all plans” drawer will avoid cognitive friction and reduce drop‑offs.

**Control:** Main paywall uses a Tier A/Tier B toggle, while the “View all plans” drawer uses a different toggle orientation and/or logic.

**Variant:** The “View all plans” drawer mirrors the main paywall’s Tier A/Tier B toggle orientation and logic exactly.

---

## Preserve paused audiences for attribution

**Description:** Test whether pausing (not deleting) completed tests preserves attribution so future renewals continue mapping back to the original variant for long-term analysis.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that pausing completed tests instead of deleting them will ensure future renewals continue attributing to the original variant, enabling more accurate long-term analysis.

**Control:** Completed tests are deleted when finished.

**Variant:** Completed tests are paused (not deleted) so the audience/variant mapping is retained for future renewals to attribute back to the original variant.

---

## Cadence policy for tests: bi-weekly for price/trial changes, weekly for pure design

**Description:** Because trial-to-paid data lags by the trial length, favor a 2-week cadence for tests that change price/trial, and weekly for pure design tests.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that a bi-weekly cadence is appropriate for tests that change price/trial due to trial-to-paid data lag, while a weekly cadence is appropriate for pure design tests.

**Control:** Pure design tests evaluated on a weekly cadence.

**Variant:** Tests that change price/trial evaluated on a bi-weekly (2-week) cadence.

---

## QA tests safely with build‑version filters

**Description:** Target paywall tests to specific app build versions to run QA-only experiments (e.g., app‑launch frequency) before releasing to production.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that targeting paywall tests to specific app build versions will enable QA-only experiments (e.g., app‑launch frequency) before releasing to production.

**Control:** Paywall tests are run without restricting by app build version.

**Variant:** Apply build‑version filters so paywall tests run only on specified QA build(s), enabling QA-only experiments such as app‑launch frequency before production release.

---

## Track trial cancel rate as a leading indicator

**Description:** Monitor same‑cohort trial cancellation rate (day‑0/1 cancels) as an early proxy for eventual trial‑to‑paid conversion and user expectation setting.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that monitoring same‑cohort day‑0/1 trial cancellation rate will serve as an early proxy for eventual trial‑to‑paid conversion and user expectation setting.

**Control:** No monitoring of same‑cohort day‑0/1 trial cancellations.

**Variant:** Monitor same‑cohort day‑0/1 trial cancellation rate as an early proxy for eventual trial‑to‑paid conversion and user expectation setting.
